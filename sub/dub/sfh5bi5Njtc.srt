1
00:00:01,565 --> 00:00:04,809
The Mysterious Transfer Student

2
00:00:11,45 --> 00:00:12,739
This is Blue Cop.

3
00:00:12,739 --> 00:00:15,277
We have not yet found Heavy Iron's vehicle.

4
00:00:15,277 --> 00:00:17,475
Resuming patrol from here.

5
00:00:21,764 --> 00:00:25,471
No sign of a large trailer here either, over.

6
00:00:27,467 --> 00:00:28,932
Ugh...

7
00:00:30,647 --> 00:00:33,522
How can such a big guy be so hard to find?

8
00:00:33,522 --> 00:00:36,630
Maybe he has the power to disappear, like someone we know.

9
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:37,567
You two!

10
00:00:38,176 --> 00:00:40,535
Now is not time for a break, is it?!

11
00:00:42,289 --> 00:00:43,932
Hey, you startled me!

12
00:00:43,932 --> 00:00:48,554
Hear hear! Let's go back to the mission! One-two, one-two! Hurry up!

13
00:00:48,554 --> 00:00:49,796
Alright, alright...

14
00:00:49,796 --> 00:00:52,760
Ugh... that nagging little brat...

15
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:54,369
No complaining!

16
00:00:54,369 --> 00:00:57,370
Everyone, please continue the search, will you?

17
00:00:57,879 --> 00:00:58,753
Okay!

18
00:00:59,504 --> 00:00:59,504
Ugh...

19
00:01:00,874 --> 00:01:02,992
I heard that sighing chases away good fortune.

20
00:01:05,884 --> 00:01:06,570
Four dollars.

21
00:01:08,292 --> 00:01:09,346
But I thought it was for free?!

22
00:01:09,888 --> 00:01:11,288
It was a joke. C'mon.

23
00:01:12,561 --> 00:01:14,866
I know how you must feel.

24
00:01:14,866 --> 00:01:20,341
We can't find Heavy Iron, who defeated Blue Cop...

25
00:01:20,341 --> 00:01:24,771
We don't know who the Metal Cardbot who helped us was...

26
00:01:24,771 --> 00:01:27,509
So, you're telling me to be patient?

27
00:01:27,509 --> 00:01:29,684
That he will turn up in time?

28
00:01:29,684 --> 00:01:31,965
No, I think we should hurry.

29
00:01:32,626 --> 00:01:34,986
Looks like it's going to rain.

30
00:01:35,499 --> 00:01:38,907
I must be going then!

31
00:01:38,907 --> 00:01:41,736
Tell them to get inside the garage when they come back.

32
00:01:41,736 --> 00:01:43,425
Alright. Take care!

33
00:01:43,425 --> 00:01:44,269
Goodbye!

34
00:01:53,20 --> 00:01:55,384
Is it really going to be raining like this?

35
00:01:59,217 --> 00:02:01,106
Hey!

36
00:02:01,106 --> 00:02:03,592
Watch where you're driving, will ya?!

37
00:02:09,651 --> 00:02:13,638
Hey, guys, quiet down! We have a new student today!

38
00:02:13,638 --> 00:02:14,610
Come on in.

39
00:02:18,187 --> 00:02:19,939
Please introduce yourself.

40
00:02:20,354 --> 00:02:22,148
My name's Crest.

41
00:02:23,771 --> 00:02:25,392
Nice to meet you all.

42
00:02:25,672 --> 00:02:27,765
Ah!

43
00:02:28,162 --> 00:02:31,34
Ah! He's so handsome!

44
00:02:31,34 --> 00:02:33,313
He'll make my channel blow up!

45
00:02:34,275 --> 00:02:37,882
What are they squealing about, huh?!

46
00:02:38,95 --> 00:02:41,728
What do you see in that guy, am I right, Jun?!

47
00:02:41,977 --> 00:02:45,250
It doesn't matter how you look! What's important is in the heart!

48
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:46,531
Right, Anna?

49
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:50,621
Aw... ...but look at that handsome face...

50
00:02:50,621 --> 00:02:53,654
Everyone settle down! Let me see...

51
00:02:53,654 --> 00:02:55,898
You can go sit behind Vance there.

52
00:02:55,898 --> 00:02:57,280
Thank you very much.

53
00:02:58,514 --> 00:03:00,771
You have something cool on your wrist.

54
00:03:00,787 --> 00:03:03,163
...y-yeah...

55
00:03:04,597 --> 00:03:08,770
Let's start the class then. Page 48 of the textbook please...

56
00:03:10,465 --> 00:03:12,447
Crest, where did you use to live?

57
00:03:12,447 --> 00:03:14,461
In Eastpolis.

58
00:03:14,461 --> 00:03:16,508
We had to move here because of my parents.

59
00:03:16,508 --> 00:03:20,426
I don't know my way around here yet. Could you show me around sometime?

60
00:03:20,426 --> 00:03:23,104
Of course! Any time!

61
00:03:23,104 --> 00:03:24,209
Awesome.

62
00:03:26,82 --> 00:03:29,968
Hmph! He's already making moves! I so hate that guy!

63
00:03:30,437 --> 00:03:32,199
Watch this!

64
00:03:36,129 --> 00:03:36,864
Watch out!

65
00:03:39,776 --> 00:03:41,340
Huh?!

66
00:03:41,686 --> 00:03:43,632
You better be careful, Vance.

67
00:03:43,632 --> 00:03:45,333
How do you know my name?!

68
00:03:45,333 --> 00:03:49,204
I memorized the name list. Of each and every student at this school.

69
00:03:49,204 --> 00:03:50,933
C'mon, that's a lie!

70
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:53,275
I'm not lying, Lavi.

71
00:03:53,275 --> 00:03:55,111
And Theo behind you.

72
00:03:55,111 --> 00:03:56,173
And Anna...

73
00:03:56,173 --> 00:03:56,965
Vera...

74
00:03:56,965 --> 00:03:57,813
Kate...

75
00:03:57,813 --> 00:03:58,809
Elaine...

76
00:03:58,809 --> 00:03:59,820
Naomi.

77
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:01,979
Wow, that's amazing!

78
00:04:01,979 --> 00:04:03,812
Just give me back my ball!

79
00:04:03,812 --> 00:04:05,193
Take it from me, then.

80
00:04:05,404 --> 00:04:06,337
Mine now!

81
00:04:15,78 --> 00:04:16,483
It went in!

82
00:04:16,483 --> 00:04:17,994
Such a good shot!

83
00:04:19,227 --> 00:04:20,833
Just a little trick I learned.

84
00:04:20,833 --> 00:04:22,452
Hey Vance, wait up!

85
00:04:22,716 --> 00:04:24,767
Did I overdo it?

86
00:04:25,55 --> 00:04:28,226
Not even Vance could do a thing...

87
00:04:29,31 --> 00:04:30,899
So his name is Crest?

88
00:04:36,285 --> 00:04:38,370
You find the new kid suspicious?

89
00:04:38,370 --> 00:04:41,48
There's something about him that doesn't seem right, you know?

90
00:04:41,48 --> 00:04:43,199
It's just not normal...

91
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:45,751
Hehe! Aren't you just jealous that Anna is obsessed, too?

92
00:04:45,751 --> 00:04:50,579
Argh, it's not that! He took an interest in my Metal Breath too!

93
00:04:50,579 --> 00:04:52,672
Something does seem a little off...

94
00:04:52,672 --> 00:04:54,93
What are you talking about?

95
00:04:54,93 --> 00:04:56,164
Aaah!

96
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:59,350
C-Crest, what are you doing here?

97
00:04:59,350 --> 00:05:01,925
I'm sorry, did we disturb you guys?

98
00:05:01,925 --> 00:05:04,50
Anna, did you bring him here?

99
00:05:04,50 --> 00:05:05,88
Well, of course!

100
00:05:05,88 --> 00:05:07,831
Crest has something he must talk to you about.

101
00:05:07,831 --> 00:05:09,947
You should have said something before coming!

102
00:05:09,947 --> 00:05:13,461
Why? You'd just be riding on your bike or something anyway.

103
00:05:13,461 --> 00:05:17,174
This isn't a playground for kids. Get yourselves home now.

104
00:05:17,174 --> 00:05:18,920
But Jun can stay?!

105
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:22,961
I never gave him permission either. He just barges in regardless!

106
00:05:22,961 --> 00:05:27,213
N-No, Uncle Edo! You told me I could come hang out any time-

107
00:05:27,213 --> 00:05:30,143
T-That's for sale! You shouldn't touch it!

108
00:05:30,143 --> 00:05:32,276
I'm sorry, I haven't seen a car like this before-

109
00:05:32,276 --> 00:05:35,888
Haha, no way, are you serious?! There are so many of these c-cars around here!

110
00:05:35,888 --> 00:05:37,876
Y-yeah...

111
00:05:37,876 --> 00:05:41,747
Crest only moved here not long ago, so it must be new to him...

112
00:05:41,747 --> 00:05:44,815
It looks a lot like the R48 used in highway patrol,

113
00:05:44,815 --> 00:05:47,296
but the shape of the bonnet is so different...

114
00:05:47,296 --> 00:05:51,299
Woah, Crest! You're an expert in cars too?!

115
00:05:51,299 --> 00:05:55,916
Well, this is a custom vehicle. It's been modified according to the owner's requirements...

116
00:05:55,916 --> 00:05:58,719
Hmm... I see, that's why...

117
00:05:58,719 --> 00:06:01,714
Haha, y-yeah! That's why!

118
00:06:01,714 --> 00:06:03,892
But what did you want to talk about?

119
00:06:03,892 --> 00:06:06,740
Yeah, I'm sorry this is sudden, but... could you do me a favor?

120
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:10,76
Just say the word! Crest can have any favor he wants!

121
00:06:10,76 --> 00:06:12,367
That's not up to you to say!

122
00:06:12,367 --> 00:06:13,826
Aah! Guys!

123
00:06:13,826 --> 00:06:15,213
What's wrong, Anna?!

124
00:06:16,585 --> 00:06:17,861
W-what is it?!

125
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:22,973
That's...

126
00:06:22,973 --> 00:06:25,242
It's the Metal Cardbot from the last time!

127
00:06:25,242 --> 00:06:27,329
The views will be out of this world!

128
00:06:27,329 --> 00:06:31,422
Bring me Blue Cop right now! I know he's here somewhere!

129
00:06:31,422 --> 00:06:34,377
W-what? Let's just see what it looks like.

130
00:06:34,377 --> 00:06:37,487
Stop. We'll be discovered if we make a move now.

131
00:06:43,136 --> 00:06:46,425
Show yourself right now, you coward!

132
00:06:47,790 --> 00:06:51,12
I'm back. I didn't find any leads either.

133
00:06:53,807 --> 00:06:54,946
Isn't that...!

134
00:06:54,946 --> 00:06:56,889
Phoenix Fire, what's going on?

135
00:06:57,146 --> 00:07:00,475
H-Hello, rescuers! Over here!

136
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:04,170
Ah! O-oh, yes!

137
00:07:04,493 --> 00:07:05,962
Get in!

138
00:07:05,962 --> 00:07:07,756
But I'm not even hurt!

139
00:07:07,756 --> 00:07:09,477
Uh... just get in for now!

140
00:07:09,477 --> 00:07:10,865
Jun? Aren't you coming?!

141
00:07:10,865 --> 00:07:13,411
W-well.. uhh... there's no space for me in there!

142
00:07:13,411 --> 00:07:18,162
I have my bike, so I'll go by myself, o-okay? Haha...

143
00:07:18,162 --> 00:07:20,152
Theo, take care of them, okay?

144
00:07:20,152 --> 00:07:22,204
Okay. You take care too.

145
00:07:27,323 --> 00:07:28,488
It's our turn, Blue Cop!

146
00:07:36,693 --> 00:07:38,602
What do we have here? Who are you?

147
00:07:38,602 --> 00:07:42,757
My name is Wild Guardy. I'm here to be king of the Metal Cardbots!

148
00:07:42,757 --> 00:07:45,666
Ha! King of us? What a joke.

149
00:07:45,666 --> 00:07:48,681
Hang on! Wild Guardy. Weren't you on our side?

150
00:07:48,681 --> 00:07:51,833
Yeah! You helped us in the battle against Heavy Iron, remember?

151
00:07:51,833 --> 00:07:57,214
Hmph. Don't be stupid. I just wanted to show the riffraff that I'm the one in charge.

152
00:07:57,214 --> 00:07:58,417
What?

153
00:07:58,417 --> 00:08:01,54
You will submit to the one and only

154
00:08:01,54 --> 00:08:02,608
Wild Guardy!

155
00:08:04,955 --> 00:08:06,334
Jun!

156
00:08:13,985 --> 00:08:15,826
Metal Breath, pickup!

157
00:08:17,607 --> 00:08:19,49
Blue Cop, setup!

158
00:08:40,656 --> 00:08:43,310
Blue Cop! Burst Shot!

159
00:08:44,891 --> 00:08:46,619
Burst Shot!

160
00:08:50,313 --> 00:08:51,756
Well done!

161
00:08:57,97 --> 00:09:00,288
It is nothing compared to my shield!

162
00:09:00,288 --> 00:09:02,872
I suppose that's not all you've got?

163
00:09:02,872 --> 00:09:04,334
Of course not!

164
00:09:04,694 --> 00:09:07,919
Blue Cop! Thunderbolt Smash!

165
00:09:11,548 --> 00:09:12,596
Thunderbolt...

166
00:09:12,679 --> 00:09:13,602
Smash!!

167
00:09:27,564 --> 00:09:30,362
The Thunderbolt Smash did nothing...

168
00:09:30,494 --> 00:09:36,619
My shield is an invincible shield trained over thousands of years on Machina planet.

169
00:09:36,619 --> 00:09:38,814
Your puny attacks have no effect!

170
00:09:46,427 --> 00:09:49,250
Wild... Slash!

171
00:09:56,850 --> 00:09:57,970
Blue Cop!

172
00:09:58,567 --> 00:10:00,954
Hey! You alright?

173
00:10:02,785 --> 00:10:04,258
Jun! Hand it to me!

174
00:10:04,527 --> 00:10:05,852
It's no use.

175
00:10:05,852 --> 00:10:07,667
None of you are any match for me.

176
00:10:07,667 --> 00:10:09,665
Huh? What did you say?

177
00:10:12,130 --> 00:10:15,590
Haaaaaaaa haa!

178
00:10:20,838 --> 00:10:21,800
Ha... ha!

179
00:10:23,125 --> 00:10:24,595
Blue Cop? Are you alright?!

180
00:10:24,595 --> 00:10:27,537
Since when have you guys been on first name terms?!

181
00:10:27,537 --> 00:10:31,534
Hmph. Another pest intruder.

182
00:10:31,534 --> 00:10:34,499
