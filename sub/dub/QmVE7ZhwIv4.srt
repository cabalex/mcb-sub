1
00:00:01,581 --> 00:00:04,755
Anna's Metal Breath

2
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:13,622
Looks like you're still coughing, I see.

3
00:00:13,622 --> 00:00:14,946
Could it be a cold?

4
00:00:14,946 --> 00:00:16,31
A cold?

5
00:00:16,31 --> 00:00:18,100
Do Metal Cardbots catch colds too?

6
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:19,804
Could it be a gremlin?

7
00:00:19,804 --> 00:00:21,254
A gremlin?!

8
00:00:21,254 --> 00:00:23,247
It's a goblin that lived on Machina planet.

9
00:00:23,247 --> 00:00:28,897
It could make the Cardbots' engines unable to stop, or make their brakes not work properly.

10
00:00:28,897 --> 00:00:31,645
So that's what catching a cold means to you.

11
00:00:31,645 --> 00:00:34,746
It's all a myth! I've never even seen a gremlin!

12
00:00:34,746 --> 00:00:37,589
It's just we know you have a bad temper!

13
00:00:37,589 --> 00:00:40,500
Want to see that temper in action?!

14
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:42,297
Achoo!

15
00:00:42,882 --> 00:00:46,117
...it's getting cold... let's head back, guys...

16
00:00:46,117 --> 00:00:48,583
You seem a little different today.

17
00:00:48,583 --> 00:00:51,132
Who, m...me? I'm the same as ever...

18
00:00:51,132 --> 00:00:53,357
Everyone... take back...!

19
00:00:54,128 --> 00:00:57,521
Mr. Edo... please take care of Fleta Z's engine...

20
00:00:57,521 --> 00:01:00,508
I'm sorry, but planes are not my specialty.

21
00:01:00,508 --> 00:01:04,14
Oh, come on, Mr. Edo! I know you can do it!

22
00:01:04,14 --> 00:01:06,41
We know you're the best mechanic ever!

23
00:01:06,41 --> 00:01:07,662
We trust you!

24
00:01:07,662 --> 00:01:09,429
Haha... I'll try to do my best...

25
00:01:09,429 --> 00:01:10,463
...ugh.

26
00:01:12,91 --> 00:01:13,711
What? A flu?

27
00:01:13,711 --> 00:01:15,115
Is Jun alright?

28
00:01:15,115 --> 00:01:16,935
Jun's parents called to say he's sick.

29
00:01:16,935 --> 00:01:20,304
It's the first time he's skipped school for a flu, isn't it?

30
00:01:20,304 --> 00:01:22,265
He seemed fine yesterday...

31
00:01:22,265 --> 00:01:24,616
Could it be...

32
00:01:24,616 --> 00:01:25,794
A gremlin's prank?!

33
00:01:28,596 --> 00:01:32,269
Why did you eat ice pops before sleeping?

34
00:01:32,269 --> 00:01:36,654
With your window opened and your tummy exposed to the cold?

35
00:01:36,654 --> 00:01:39,762
Now look at you...

36
00:01:39,762 --> 00:01:43,30
His throat is so sore, he can't talk...

37
00:01:43,30 --> 00:01:44,171
Oh, dear me...

38
00:01:44,171 --> 00:01:49,472
The doctor said it's just a common cold. He'll be better after a day of rest and sleep.

39
00:01:49,472 --> 00:01:52,115
Jun... get well soon...

40
00:01:53,379 --> 00:01:54,568
Huh.

41
00:01:54,568 --> 00:01:56,392
This is a great opportunity!

42
00:01:56,392 --> 00:01:59,146
The Metal Breath may well already be in our hands!

43
00:01:59,146 --> 00:02:02,874
But... it's bad luck to get in the way of a gremlin's trick.

44
00:02:02,874 --> 00:02:05,922
Wait... do you really believe in such a myth?

45
00:02:05,922 --> 00:02:08,36
It is the fool who doesn't believe.

46
00:02:08,36 --> 00:02:10,458
Want to lecture on who is the fool? Really?

47
00:02:10,458 --> 00:02:12,835
No need. We can all see that you are!

48
00:02:12,835 --> 00:02:16,664
Hey, hey! It doesn't matter if gremlins exist or not!

49
00:02:16,664 --> 00:02:21,130
It would be a disgrace to lose the treasure in front of our eyes!

50
00:02:21,130 --> 00:02:23,224
We shall set sail, Black Crew!

51
00:02:23,224 --> 00:02:24,386
...not that way, though.

52
00:02:24,386 --> 00:02:25,502
...looks like Captain's the fool.

53
00:02:25,502 --> 00:02:26,478
Be quiet!

54
00:02:28,964 --> 00:02:31,470
Uh... Theo...

55
00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:33,617
Do you think this might actually be dangerous?

56
00:02:33,617 --> 00:02:34,806
What is?

57
00:02:34,806 --> 00:02:38,924
If Jun can't talk, that means... he can't use the Metal Breath to...

58
00:02:38,924 --> 00:02:41,237
Right! He can't summon the Cardbots!

59
00:02:41,237 --> 00:02:42,377
Let's go!

60
00:02:42,972 --> 00:02:44,575
Hey, wait for me, Anna!

61
00:02:46,22 --> 00:02:47,282
Jun has a flu?

62
00:02:47,282 --> 00:02:51,513
Help us, Fleta Z! You're the only one that can protect Jun!

63
00:02:51,513 --> 00:02:52,944
Of course I'll help.

64
00:02:52,944 --> 00:02:53,800
Really?!

65
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:57,98
Fleta Z. But your engine is still choking out...

66
00:02:58,559 --> 00:03:03,497
Still... I cannot turn down a beautiful lady like Anna, who needs my help.

67
00:03:03,998 --> 00:03:07,79
What they're after is Jun's Metal Breath!

68
00:03:07,247 --> 00:03:09,112
I have an idea.

69
00:03:09,112 --> 00:03:10,824
What are you going to do?

70
00:03:18,755 --> 00:03:21,295
We're about to arrive. Be prepared!

71
00:03:35,244 --> 00:03:37,249
Who are you, little lady?!

72
00:03:37,547 --> 00:03:39,391
Who are we?

73
00:03:42,67 --> 00:03:45,253
The sonic speed hero, Fleta Z!

74
00:03:45,253 --> 00:03:48,415
Guardian of peace, Anna!

75
00:03:48,415 --> 00:03:49,959
Together we are...

76
00:03:49,959 --> 00:03:51,622
Z and Anna!

77
00:03:51,622 --> 00:03:53,310
Robbers with their eye on our treasure?

78
00:03:53,310 --> 00:03:55,330
We will send you...

79
00:03:55,330 --> 00:03:57,575
Back to space!!

80
00:03:57,575 --> 00:03:59,14
Wohohoho...

81
00:03:59,14 --> 00:04:00,874
We're not interested in you!

82
00:04:00,874 --> 00:04:03,309
All we want is the Metal Breath!

83
00:04:03,309 --> 00:04:04,479
Out of my way!

84
00:04:04,479 --> 00:04:06,389
Really? the Metal Breath?

85
00:04:06,389 --> 00:04:07,850
You mean this thing?

86
00:04:09,117 --> 00:04:10,150
No way!

87
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:12,260
H-How do you have the treasure from Deus Machina?!

88
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:16,315
If you thought Jun was the only one that could use the Metal Breath,

89
00:04:16,315 --> 00:04:17,532
you're totally wrong!

90
00:04:17,532 --> 00:04:20,875
How weird. I don't smell anything of Deus Machina in that child.

91
00:04:20,875 --> 00:04:22,277
Impossible!

92
00:04:22,277 --> 00:04:24,687
Uh... yeah! Is your nose blocked or something?

93
00:04:24,687 --> 00:04:26,162
What?! You have a cold?!

94
00:04:26,162 --> 00:04:27,972
Me?! Get a cold?! Never!

95
00:04:27,972 --> 00:04:31,57
Anna! We need to get them away from Jun's house!

96
00:04:31,57 --> 00:04:32,964
Right, of course!

97
00:04:32,964 --> 00:04:35,663
Fleta Z, fly!

98
00:04:36,679 --> 00:04:38,196
Let's go!

99
00:04:40,164 --> 00:04:41,791
Stop them!

100
00:04:48,505 --> 00:04:50,65
Just fire, Buster Gallon!

101
00:04:50,65 --> 00:04:51,302
I know!

102
00:04:54,716 --> 00:04:55,974
Are you okay?

103
00:04:55,974 --> 00:04:57,44
Y-yeah, don't worry-

104
00:04:58,938 --> 00:04:59,770
Hang on tight!

105
00:05:04,511 --> 00:05:05,717
Are you alright, Anna?!

106
00:05:05,717 --> 00:05:08,569
I-I told you n-not to worry!

107
00:05:09,125 --> 00:05:10,882
Yeah, but you're not saying you're okay...

108
00:05:10,882 --> 00:05:13,212
Fleta Z? What's going on?

109
00:05:13,212 --> 00:05:14,549
Don't worry. It's nothing.

110
00:05:14,549 --> 00:05:15,682
J- Aaah!

111
00:05:15,682 --> 00:05:17,913
Fleta Z! Where are you?!

112
00:05:23,469 --> 00:05:25,206
You little rat!

113
00:05:25,206 --> 00:05:27,380
You won't get away.

114
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:28,211
Fire...

115
00:05:28,211 --> 00:05:29,195
Chest Cannon!

116
00:05:36,921 --> 00:05:38,410
Is that a homing cannon?

117
00:05:38,410 --> 00:05:39,913
Anna. Hang on!

118
00:05:41,145 --> 00:05:42,614
Aaaah!

119
00:05:46,163 --> 00:05:49,0
Huh? Look at that, the child is falling!

120
00:05:49,0 --> 00:05:50,289
He abandoned his master!

121
00:05:50,289 --> 00:05:51,561
Now's our chance, Black Hook!

122
00:05:51,561 --> 00:05:53,125
I said call me captain!

123
00:06:08,28 --> 00:06:09,410
Oh no...

124
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:11,985
I don't think I can stay in the sky. I'll get back to land.

125
00:06:12,363 --> 00:06:13,705
Waaah!

126
00:06:14,267 --> 00:06:16,650
It sounds like they are in battle.

127
00:06:16,650 --> 00:06:18,603
It must be Black Hook's gang!

128
00:06:18,603 --> 00:06:21,75
So... he's fighting the three of them by himself?

129
00:06:21,75 --> 00:06:24,871
What can we do? We can't help in our current state!

130
00:06:24,871 --> 00:06:25,887
Woah!

131
00:06:28,177 --> 00:06:30,448
Jun. Are you awake?

132
00:06:30,448 --> 00:06:31,597
Uh huh...

133
00:06:35,855 --> 00:06:37,107
We're safe now.

134
00:06:37,107 --> 00:06:40,630
I... Fleta Z... thank you...

135
00:06:40,630 --> 00:06:42,876
S-sorry... are you alright now?

136
00:06:44,433 --> 00:06:45,799
Over there!

137
00:06:49,681 --> 00:06:52,641
How did I get hit by my own Chest Cannon...

138
00:06:52,641 --> 00:06:55,371
Not too bad! I underestimated you!

139
00:06:55,371 --> 00:06:57,91
You won't get away this time!

140
00:06:57,271 --> 00:07:00,487
Now. Hand over the Metal Breath immediately.

141
00:07:00,487 --> 00:07:02,763
This is bad.

142
00:07:02,763 --> 00:07:05,875
Don't dilly dally about! Just send it over!

143
00:07:06,327 --> 00:07:08,948
Aah! Fleta Z, sit down!

144
00:07:11,451 --> 00:07:12,489
That was close!

145
00:07:12,489 --> 00:07:13,255
I'm sorry...

146
00:07:13,255 --> 00:07:15,286
Buster Blaster!

147
00:07:16,35 --> 00:07:17,164
Uhh... roll away!

148
00:07:20,46 --> 00:07:21,4
Oh no...

149
00:07:22,190 --> 00:07:25,679
Z and Anna Punch!

150
00:07:25,679 --> 00:07:28,156
Z and Anna... Punch!!

151
00:07:29,827 --> 00:07:33,963
Jun! I came home early today! Are you feeling better?

152
00:07:33,963 --> 00:07:35,168
Huh? Jun?

153
00:07:39,349 --> 00:07:42,298
Yes! We did it!

154
00:07:42,298 --> 00:07:44,333
What a disgrace...

155
00:07:44,333 --> 00:07:47,415
How odd... why doesn't he use his bow?

156
00:07:47,415 --> 00:07:49,852
How do you like the power of Z and Anna-

157
00:07:49,852 --> 00:07:50,940
Oh...!

158
00:07:59,254 --> 00:08:02,484
Uhh...

159
00:08:04,309 --> 00:08:06,99
The Metal Breath...

160
00:08:07,384 --> 00:08:09,492
Huh?!

161
00:08:09,492 --> 00:08:10,719
It's a fake!

162
00:08:10,719 --> 00:08:12,383
You brat tricked us!

163
00:08:13,655 --> 00:08:15,121
Insolent little lady! You will not be forgiven!

164
00:08:15,890 --> 00:08:17,678
Oh no! Anna! Watch out!

165
00:08:17,678 --> 00:08:21,225
Captain's Cannon! Fire!

166
00:08:26,643 --> 00:08:28,539
Anna... are you alright?

167
00:08:28,539 --> 00:08:30,915
I... can't anymore...

168
00:08:30,915 --> 00:08:33,610
You will pay for playing foolish games with the Black Crew!

169
00:08:33,610 --> 00:08:34,781
Yeah! You will!

170
00:08:34,781 --> 00:08:36,45
And with interest!

171
00:08:36,45 --> 00:08:38,6
Get ready!

172
00:08:38,6 --> 00:08:40,13
Spinning Cutter!

173
00:08:42,596 --> 00:08:43,533
What?

174
00:08:44,169 --> 00:08:46,334
Haha! Sorry I'm late!

175
00:08:47,115 --> 00:08:48,70
Jun!

176
00:08:48,510 --> 00:08:50,56
That little brat!

177
00:08:50,56 --> 00:08:52,948
So is that the real Metal Breath?!

178
00:08:52,948 --> 00:08:57,297
But he can't even talk with the flu! How was he summoned?!

179
00:08:57,297 --> 00:09:00,326
Jun and I are connected in spirit. We don't need to talk.

180
00:09:00,326 --> 00:09:02,4
That's ridiculous.

181
00:09:02,4 --> 00:09:03,133
Whatever it is!

182
00:09:03,133 --> 00:09:05,666
They are here and we have one thing to do!

183
00:09:05,666 --> 00:09:07,608
Take the Metal Breath now!

184
00:09:07,608 --> 00:09:08,899
Aah, whatever!

185
00:09:10,478 --> 00:09:13,778
P-Phoenix Fire... setup...

186
00:09:19,528 --> 00:09:21,944

00:11:16,448 --> 00:11:19,29
You're burning up! Let's get you home!

214
00:11:19,29 --> 00:11:21,961
