00:00:01,519 --> 00:00:04,825
Metal Breath Gets Stolen

2
00:00:07,929 --> 00:00:09,725
The Metal Breath?

3
00:00:09,725 --> 00:00:14,160
The Metal Breath is the legendary treasure from Machina planet.

4
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:16,686
Now it's on the minor planet...

5
00:00:16,686 --> 00:00:18,534
I know what I saw!

6
00:00:18,534 --> 00:00:22,420
I'm sure that child's bracelet is the very one Deus Machina left behind.

7
00:00:22,420 --> 00:00:25,884
I saw with my own eyes, Buster Gallon!

8
00:00:25,884 --> 00:00:29,876
The child from this planet was commanding the Star Guardian like a minion!

9
00:00:29,876 --> 00:00:32,99
Black Hook, what I want to know is-

10
00:00:32,99 --> 00:00:33,530
Call me Captain.

11
00:00:33,530 --> 00:00:35,439
Yeah, uh, whatever... Captain.

12
00:00:35,439 --> 00:00:37,6
What is it, Buster Gallon?

13
00:00:37,6 --> 00:00:42,744
Ahem. What I want to know is... what do you plan to do once you have taken the Metal Breath?

14
00:00:42,744 --> 00:00:45,45
Hmm. What do you think you would do?

15
00:00:45,45 --> 00:00:48,895
Well, the one who has the Metal Breath can rule all Metal Cardbots.

16
00:00:48,895 --> 00:00:51,638
I'd use that power to conquer the universe!

17
00:00:51,638 --> 00:00:54,122
Then we can divide it among us three, of course.

18
00:00:54,122 --> 00:00:55,603
That sounds fun.

19
00:00:55,603 --> 00:00:58,513
Yes. That is how it should be!

20
00:00:58,513 --> 00:01:01,993
But the child has Blue Cop, a Star Guardian by his side!

21
00:01:01,993 --> 00:01:03,396
It will not be easy.

22
00:01:03,396 --> 00:01:06,295
Is there a way around it?

23
00:01:06,295 --> 00:01:09,565
Of course there is. You can leave it to me.

24
00:01:46,767 --> 00:01:49,103
Mom! Where are the towels?!

25
00:01:49,630 --> 00:01:52,93
I told you to take them when you were going up!

26
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:55,294
I'm busy cleaning! You take them yourself!

27
00:01:55,294 --> 00:01:57,561
Augh, Mom!

28
00:01:57,687 --> 00:01:59,836
Ugh. Fine.

29
00:02:07,389 --> 00:02:10,707
Ugh. Don't get into the habit of doing this.

30
00:02:11,318 --> 00:02:12,973
I'll leave the towel here!

31
00:02:12,973 --> 00:02:14,615
I love you, Mom!

32
00:02:14,615 --> 00:02:15,975
Ugh. Save it.

33
00:02:16,690 --> 00:02:17,639
Hmph.

34
00:02:19,869 --> 00:02:21,908
Aaaiyah!

35
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:25,493
Aah! What are those animals?!

36
00:02:29,97 --> 00:02:30,479
What, Mom?! What is it?!

37
00:02:30,479 --> 00:02:32,258
There are some strange mice!

38
00:02:32,258 --> 00:02:32,842
Huh?

39
00:02:32,842 --> 00:02:33,914
Here-

40
00:02:35,56 --> 00:02:36,877
Uh... Dearie, look out for the mice!

41
00:02:36,877 --> 00:02:39,345
I'll check downstairs!

42
00:02:39,345 --> 00:02:41,893
What? Did you say mice, darling?

43
00:02:47,508 --> 00:02:49,258
Ah, feeling fresh!

44
00:02:49,258 --> 00:02:51,172
Oh, my Metal Breath!

45
00:03:25,982 --> 00:03:32,0
...uh... Heavy Iron...

46
00:03:32,0 --> 00:03:35,379
...sealing... I'm gonna seal it...

47
00:04:04,931 --> 00:04:07,247
Wha... where did it...

48
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:09,98
When did it drop there?

49
00:04:14,262 --> 00:04:16,721
Aaah!

50
00:04:19,824 --> 00:04:20,938
Stop right there!

51
00:04:21,956 --> 00:04:24,481
W-what just happened?!

52
00:04:25,478 --> 00:04:27,650
Waugh!

53
00:04:28,966 --> 00:04:32,372
The Mini Gallons have succeeded in stealing the Metal Breath.

54
00:04:32,372 --> 00:04:34,76
Although... it did take them some time.

55
00:04:34,76 --> 00:04:35,660
Well done, Buster Gallon!

56
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:37,137
Heheh. Bring it over quickly!

57
00:04:38,339 --> 00:04:40,220
Hm? Good morning, Jun-

58
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:41,342
Give it back!

59
00:04:50,905 --> 00:04:52,443
Where did they go?

60
00:04:53,113 --> 00:04:55,366
Uh, what's all the racket this morning?

61
00:04:56,144 --> 00:04:57,887
Where are you going?!

62
00:04:57,992 --> 00:04:58,748
Oh!

63
00:04:59,101 --> 00:05:00,131
Sorry, Mom!

64
00:05:00,729 --> 00:05:02,946
Hey! What's going on?!

65
00:05:07,299 --> 00:05:08,142
Gotcha!

66
00:05:15,34 --> 00:05:16,954
Uh... Jun, what are you doing here?

67
00:05:16,954 --> 00:05:19,606
Did you forget that we were doing our homework together?

68
00:05:19,606 --> 00:05:22,554
That's not important right now! The Metal Breath has been st-

69
00:05:22,554 --> 00:05:24,604
Oh? Where did they go?!

70
00:05:24,604 --> 00:05:25,790
The Metal Breath...

71
00:05:25,790 --> 00:05:28,118
Stop right there!

72
00:05:28,118 --> 00:05:29,901
...The Metal Breath got stolen?!

73
00:05:31,87 --> 00:05:32,882
How did it happen? Did it get stolen really-

74
00:05:32,882 --> 00:05:36,753
It's those mini things over there! They took Black Hook's friend!

75
00:05:36,753 --> 00:05:38,235
Juuuuun!!

76
00:05:38,235 --> 00:05:39,763
I said stop!

77
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:45,891
Just a little more!

78
00:05:53,673 --> 00:05:54,866
Just a little more, Jun!

79
00:05:55,305 --> 00:05:56,337
Stop!

80
00:05:58,159 --> 00:05:59,380
I got them!

81
00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:01,393
Anna, you're the best!

82
00:06:01,393 --> 00:06:03,491
I, wait! Stay still!

83
00:06:03,491 --> 00:06:08,376
I... can't hold them... any longer! Do something!

84
00:06:09,332 --> 00:06:10,641
Anna, are you alright?!

85
00:06:11,58 --> 00:06:13,576
Ow... I'm really sorry, Jun...

86
00:06:13,576 --> 00:06:16,844
It's okay, I think... we've driven them to right direction!

87
00:06:16,844 --> 00:06:20,12
Luckily they are going to Mr. Edo's car repair shop!

88
00:06:21,281 --> 00:06:23,449
Huh? They are hiding in here?

89
00:06:23,449 --> 00:06:26,549
Yes! So please help me look for them too!

90
00:06:26,549 --> 00:06:28,501
Come on guys, I need your help!

91
00:06:28,501 --> 00:06:36,287
Those pesky things... even if they came in here, it will take some time to find them...

92
00:06:38,677 --> 00:06:42,98
They're just going round and round in the same spot.

93
00:06:42,98 --> 00:06:43,117
Are they broken?

94
00:06:43,117 --> 00:06:44,640
That's impossible!

95
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:45,755
Where is this?

96
00:06:45,755 --> 00:06:48,372
A... car repair shop in the outskirts of Mowtown.

97
00:06:48,372 --> 00:06:49,561
I'll go take a look.

98
00:06:49,561 --> 00:06:51,548
Where are you going?!

99
00:06:52,209 --> 00:06:53,379
I'll come with you!

100
00:06:58,790 --> 00:07:01,357
Hm. Got a bad feeling about this.

101
00:07:09,137 --> 00:07:10,239
You rats!

102
00:07:10,239 --> 00:07:11,433
Great job!

103
00:07:20,86 --> 00:07:22,48
Those tiny things have some guts!

104
00:07:30,710 --> 00:07:32,640
I got an idea. Listen carefully!

105
00:07:57,259 --> 00:07:59,689
Aha! I got it!

106
00:08:06,569 --> 00:08:08,331
Metal Cardbot, setup!

107
00:08:19,102 --> 00:08:21,678
Trying to steal us? You have some guts.

108
00:08:21,678 --> 00:08:23,874
Yeah. They sure do.

109
00:08:23,874 --> 00:08:25,915
Let's give them some attention.

110
00:08:25,915 --> 00:08:30,19
I agree. Shall we get them to spill the whereabouts of Black Hook's lair?

111
00:08:32,501 --> 00:08:34,126
They are leaving again!

112
00:08:34,126 --> 00:08:36,904
No more chasing for me...

113
00:08:37,872 --> 00:08:39,703
Hand over the little ones!

114
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:41,795
Wha...?

115
00:08:42,204 --> 00:08:45,983
Buffalo Crush! Just barging in like that won't solve anything!

116
00:08:46,734 --> 00:08:47,794
Huh?

117
00:08:48,368 --> 00:08:51,596
Aah! My little mini-mes!

118
00:08:51,596 --> 00:08:54,722
What's happened here...

119
00:08:54,722 --> 00:08:59,832
Huh... uh, uh... I don't know...

120
00:08:59,832 --> 00:09:02,324
Hey! What are you here for anyway?

121
00:09:02,324 --> 00:09:04,567
Buffalo Crush! Let's retreat for now!

122
00:09:04,567 --> 00:09:09,98
No retreat! I'm taking both Jun and the Metal Breath!

123
00:09:09,98 --> 00:09:10,290
Yaaah!!

124
00:09:10,290 --> 00:09:11,208
Buffalo Crush!

125
00:09:11,208 --> 00:09:13,396
It's revenge for the little ones!

126
00:09:13,396 --> 00:09:14,794
You did that to them!

127
00:09:18,832 --> 00:09:20,154
Metal Breath, pickup!

128
00:09:24,136 --> 00:09:25,442
Dexter, setup!

129
00:09:31,964 --> 00:09:34,465
Dexter, Helix Sword!

130
00:09:36,429 --> 00:09:38,432
Helix Sword!

131
00:09:45,608 --> 00:09:48,924
We have to make a hole in that axe! Spear Thrust!

132
00:09:48,924 --> 00:09:50,53
What? Hole?

133
00:09:50,53 --> 00:09:52,910
Spear Thrust!

134
00:09:55,906 --> 00:09:58,53
Buffalo Crush, step aside please!

135
00:10:04,586 --> 00:10:06,177
Chest Cannon!

136
00:10:10,846 --> 00:10:13,286
You better get going, Buffalo Crush!

137
00:10:13,286 --> 00:10:14,928
I can still fight!

138
00:10:14,928 --> 00:10:16,454
Now is not the time!

139
00:10:21,870 --> 00:10:25,516
You need to know when to stop, Buffalo Crush!

140
00:10:25,516 --> 00:10:27,231
Black Hook!

141
00:10:27,231 --> 00:10:30,797
I'll admit, today was a defeat for the Black Crew!

142
00:10:30,797 --> 00:10:32,17
The Black Crew?

143
00:10:32,17 --> 00:10:33,531
B... Black Crew?

144
00:10:33,531 --> 00:10:37,1
I'm not your underling! I reject that name!

145
00:10:37,1 --> 00:10:39,562
And you're not black, by the way! You're blue!

146
00:10:39,562 --> 00:10:40,740
Silence!

147
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:42,372
I told you to call me Captain!

148
00:10:42,372 --> 00:10:45,24
I better stay put. Things are getting messy.

149
00:10:45,24 --> 00:10:50,617
Ahem. Anyways! The legacy of Deus Machina will be mine!

150
00:10:50,617 --> 00:10:52,593
The legacy of Deus Machina?

151
00:10:52,593 --> 00:10:54,933
If you mean the Metal Breath, that's a misunderstanding!

152
00:10:54,933 --> 00:10:57,537
Why should I believe you?

153
00:11:07,883 --> 00:11:10,515
Ah! All done.

154
00:11:10,515 --> 00:11:13,380
Hey Wild Guardy, your sword is as good as-

155
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:15,301
Uhh.... that's great...!

156
00:11:15,301 --> 00:11:16,975
Right, yeah...!

157
00:11:16,975 --> 00:11:18,770
Hey, kids...

158
00:11:18,770 --> 00:11:22,36
Mister Edo...

159
00:11:22,36 --> 00:11:24,735
I hope you can explain this.

160
00:11:24,735 --> 00:11:27,614
Uh, well...
