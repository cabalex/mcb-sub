1
00:00:01,568 --> 00:00:04,852
Mystery of the Police Car Robot!

2
00:00:47,731 --> 00:00:49,564
I was so close...

3
00:00:50,310 --> 00:00:51,692
Hm?

4
00:00:51,692 --> 00:00:54,615
Ah! I'm going to be late for school!

5
00:01:00,283 --> 00:01:01,651
Hm?

6
00:01:01,850 --> 00:01:03,454
Huh, what's that?

7
00:01:27,733 --> 00:01:30,406
A... robot?

8
00:01:30,463 --> 00:01:32,417
This ends now, Mega Trucker!

9
00:01:32,847 --> 00:01:34,700
You'll have to come with me.

10
00:01:38,783 --> 00:01:40,223
That's what you'd like, Blue Cop.

11
00:01:40,454 --> 00:01:41,823
Wouldn't you?!

12
00:01:44,973 --> 00:01:47,831
Look here, it's not over yet!

13
00:01:48,698 --> 00:01:50,640
You stubborn old truck!

14
00:01:55,789 --> 00:01:57,188
My BMX!

15
00:02:11,163 --> 00:02:12,859
A human boy...?

16
00:02:16,104 --> 00:02:19,780
Ugh! This isn't over!

17
00:02:21,99 --> 00:02:22,276
Stop right there!

18
00:02:27,175 --> 00:02:30,889
What have you done to my bike!!

19
00:02:30,889 --> 00:02:33,567
And where did my helmet go?

20
00:02:43,543 --> 00:02:46,295
Hey, we'll be in middle school next year

21
00:02:46,295 --> 00:02:47,117
and you're still saying,

22
00:02:47,117 --> 00:02:49,639
"I saw a robot! I saw an alien!"

23
00:02:49,639 --> 00:02:51,961
How old are you?

24
00:02:51,961 --> 00:02:54,120
Oh my God, Vance, you're so funny!

25
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:56,533
I swear I saw it with my own eyes!

26
00:02:56,533 --> 00:02:58,469
A police car transformed into a robot!

27
00:02:58,469 --> 00:03:00,790
Oh really? Where's the evidence, huh?

28
00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:02,235
Uhhh...

29
00:03:02,235 --> 00:03:03,800
Look at my crushed BMX!

30
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:07,169
Uh... sorry, but it just looks like you fell and broke your own bike.

31
00:03:07,169 --> 00:03:11,336
Ha! You made up a story about a robot for that?! Vance, you're sharp!

32
00:03:11,436 --> 00:03:15,510
You should have made up a more believable story, Jun.

33
00:03:15,510 --> 00:03:16,900
I don't think he's lying.

34
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:17,838
Huh?

35
00:03:18,337 --> 00:03:20,348
But Anna, what do you mean by that?

36
00:03:20,449 --> 00:03:23,143
You couldn't be thinking that Vance is wrong?!

37
00:03:23,143 --> 00:03:26,652
I just know Jun wouldn't make up a silly story like that.

38
00:03:26,652 --> 00:03:29,947
That's right, Anna! You know you can always trust me!

39
00:03:29,947 --> 00:03:32,807
I think he's probably just mistaken.

40
00:03:36,313 --> 00:03:39,80
Ugh... she didn't believe me either...

41
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:41,920
I believe you saw the robot, Jun.

42
00:03:42,751 --> 00:03:44,699
Theo!

43
00:03:46,223 --> 00:03:47,352
Security cameras?

44
00:03:47,352 --> 00:03:50,848
If what you said did happen, something must have been caught on video!

45
00:03:50,848 --> 00:03:52,288
Oh, right!

46
00:03:53,603 --> 00:03:54,461
Huh?

47
00:03:55,204 --> 00:03:57,860
Yeah, so when I got here this morning, I saw-

48
00:03:57,860 --> 00:03:59,439
Huh? Jun!

49
00:04:00,639 --> 00:04:02,443
Jun, you're safe and sound!

50
00:04:02,443 --> 00:04:06,169
Stop it! I can't breathe!

51
00:04:06,169 --> 00:04:09,804
I mean I was worried, you know? When I got here, everything was a mess!

52
00:04:09,804 --> 00:04:14,936
I saw your bike and thought something happened to you too!

53
00:04:14,936 --> 00:04:17,713
Hehe... I'm sorry, Edo...

54
00:04:18,129 --> 00:04:19,538
Alright, I'm good now.

55
00:04:19,738 --> 00:04:22,108
Seems like it's all good. We'll be off, then.

56
00:04:22,108 --> 00:04:23,454
Thanks for coming!

57
00:04:23,454 --> 00:04:24,406
Thanks.

58
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:30,302
Tell me, what brings you guys here?

59
00:04:30,302 --> 00:04:32,113
We need the security footage!

60
00:04:32,747 --> 00:04:34,125
Huh?

61
00:04:37,579 --> 00:04:38,105
Look over here!

62
00:04:38,105 --> 00:04:40,156
Rewind a little bit, please!

63
00:04:45,101 --> 00:04:46,558
It's all covered up...

64
00:04:46,558 --> 00:04:48,630
Yeah, didn't even get the license plate...

65
00:04:48,630 --> 00:04:51,271
If we only had the license plate for the police car-

66
00:04:51,271 --> 00:04:55,119
What would you do with that? Would you go to the police station and ask,

67
00:04:55,119 --> 00:04:56,937
"Is there a car here that transforms into a robot?"

68
00:04:56,937 --> 00:04:59,161
I knew it! You don't believe me either!

69
00:04:59,161 --> 00:05:01,192
Who would believe that story...?

70
00:05:01,192 --> 00:05:04,173
If only there was some other clue...

71
00:05:04,173 --> 00:05:06,112
Hang on! I have this!

72
00:05:08,119 --> 00:05:10,393
I picked it up when all of that happened.

73
00:05:10,393 --> 00:05:12,502
Did the robots leave that behind?

74
00:05:12,502 --> 00:05:13,952
I think it could be.

75
00:05:13,952 --> 00:05:17,449
I think it could be something you could buy in any shop.

76
00:05:25,548 --> 00:05:27,331
Stop fooling around, Edo...

77
00:05:27,331 --> 00:05:31,516
Agh, no! I really can't lift it! It really won't come off at all!

78
00:05:32,615 --> 00:05:34,487
I'll give it a go, then.

79
00:05:36,644 --> 00:05:38,167
I can't move it at all, not an inch!

80
00:05:38,266 --> 00:05:41,233
Nah, you're just kidding! See?

81
00:05:41,233 --> 00:05:43,281
Agh! What's going on?!

82
00:05:43,281 --> 00:05:45,735
That's what I should be asking...

83
00:05:47,252 --> 00:05:50,159
Let's look for a place where a dump truck might be parked...

84
00:05:50,159 --> 00:05:52,290
You guys never give up, do you?

85
00:05:52,290 --> 00:05:55,627
You're trying to impress Anna, aren't you?

86
00:05:55,627 --> 00:05:57,519
Nah, not at all, Theo!

87
00:05:57,519 --> 00:05:58,624
I'll be back soon!

88
00:05:58,624 --> 00:06:01,519
Please tell me you'll throw away that strange watch, will you?

89
00:06:01,519 --> 00:06:02,711
Yeah, I will!

90
00:06:18,545 --> 00:06:21,788
Ugh... guess it wouldn't be easy to find, right?

91
00:06:21,788 --> 00:06:24,970
It might not even be in this town anymore...

92
00:06:24,970 --> 00:06:26,485
Stop it!

93
00:06:26,485 --> 00:06:27,596
Anna?!

94
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,211
Tell us, what's the matter, Anna?

95
00:06:30,211 --> 00:06:32,273
Do you think you are better than us?!

96
00:06:32,273 --> 00:06:36,627
That's not it! You're vandalizing our city without permission!

97
00:06:36,927 --> 00:06:38,903
You just think you're always right!

98
00:06:38,903 --> 00:06:43,989
Why do you care so much about this city? You want to get sprayed too?!

99
00:06:43,989 --> 00:06:45,105
Stop it!

100
00:06:45,271 --> 00:06:46,297
Stop it!

101
00:06:46,829 --> 00:06:47,891
J-Jun?

102
00:06:47,891 --> 00:06:50,230
So you want to play being a hero?

103
00:06:50,230 --> 00:06:51,358
What about the robot?

104
00:06:51,358 --> 00:06:52,901
I'll find it soon!

105
00:06:52,901 --> 00:06:55,177
You sound quite confident!

106
00:06:58,161 --> 00:07:01,824
Agh! I stepped on poop...

107
00:07:01,824 --> 00:07:03,779
Want a taste?!

108
00:07:03,779 --> 00:07:06,586
Get away, get away!

109
00:07:07,187 --> 00:07:10,485
How dare you! Aah!

110
00:07:10,786 --> 00:07:13,555
You fell for it! See you later, Anna!

111
00:07:13,555 --> 00:07:14,437
Jun!

112
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:33,769
Ta-da!

113
00:07:38,588 --> 00:07:40,233
Not too bad!

114
00:07:40,233 --> 00:07:42,836
You cannot run anymore!

115
00:07:42,836 --> 00:07:45,754
Let's not resort to any kind of violence, you guys!

116
00:07:45,754 --> 00:07:46,939
Shut up!

117
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:49,332
Hey! You give that back!

118
00:07:49,832 --> 00:07:52,838
This is for tricking me, you fool!

119
00:07:53,538 --> 00:07:54,295
Hey!

120
00:07:54,295 --> 00:07:55,749
Stop struggling!

121
00:08:01,973 --> 00:08:03,963
I said, stop it!

122
00:08:30,946 --> 00:08:32,865
What have you done now?

123
00:08:42,573 --> 00:08:44,778
That's the robot I saw...

124
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:56,188
Wha...

125
00:08:56,188 --> 00:08:57,788
A robot! Jun was telling the truth!

126
00:08:57,788 --> 00:08:59,557
Come on, that's impossible!

127
00:08:59,557 --> 00:09:01,442
I'm sure it was just a trick!

128
00:09:01,442 --> 00:09:02,990
But I don't think so, Vance...

129
00:09:02,990 --> 00:09:06,620
Listen up! You better not tell anyone about this,

130
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:09,711
unless you want to be called a liar just like Jun!

131
00:09:09,711 --> 00:09:11,725
Alright...

132
00:09:13,958 --> 00:09:16,764
Aah! What's going on?!

133
00:09:24,308 --> 00:09:25,599
How is this happening?!

134
00:09:25,599 --> 00:09:26,831
Let me introduce myself.

135
00:09:26,831 --> 00:09:27,447
Huh?

136
00:09:27,447 --> 00:09:29,899
I am Blue Cop, from planet Machina.

137
00:09:29,899 --> 00:09:31,389
Blue Cop?

138
00:09:32,971 --> 00:09:37,529
Agh! Does this mean I am actually inside a robot?! Seriously?!

139
00:09:39,672 --> 00:09:41,605
Help, I've been eaten by a robot!!

140
00:09:41,605 --> 00:09:43,946
Huh? Calm down!

141
00:09:43,946 --> 00:09:45,869
Get me out before I am digested!

142
00:09:45,869 --> 00:09:46,979
Digested?

143
00:09:46,979 --> 00:09:49,981
Hang on, please don't push me down! Send me back up!

144
00:09:49,981 --> 00:09:53,418
I am a mechanical lifeform. I don't digest anything.

145
00:09:53,418 --> 00:09:54,899
Oh, really?

146
00:09:54,899 --> 00:09:56,789
It's going to get a little bumpy.

147
00:09:56,879 --> 00:09:58,644
Aah!

148
00:10:01,798 --> 00:10:05,668
My home, Machina planet, was completely annihilated by a giant explosion.

149
00:10:05,668 --> 00:10:06,817
Annihilated?

150
00:10:06,817 --> 00:10:12,533
Since I came to this planet, I have been disguising myself as a car to avoid alarming the natives.

151
00:10:12,533 --> 00:10:15,692
As you say, a tree is best hidden in a forest.

152
00:10:15,692 --> 00:10:16,916
That actually makes sense...

153
00:10:17,716 --> 00:10:19,875
I have to live on planet Earth now.

154
00:10:20,575 --> 00:10:24,838
So I am trying to learn as much about this planet as quickly as I can.

155
00:10:29,493 --> 00:10:31,368
I like this planet very much.

156
00:10:31,368 --> 00:10:34,629
However, there are some of my kind who have not adjusted to life here.

157
00:10:34,629 --> 00:10:36,999
You mean, like that dump truck from yesterday?

158
00:10:36,999 --> 00:10:38,778
It's not the only one.

159
00:10:38,778 --> 00:10:43,628
There are more Metal Cardbots hiding on planet Earth right now.

160
00:10:43,628 --> 00:10:46,138
I only wish to help them, so that they do not cause any harm to the natives of this planet.

161
00:10:46,138 --> 00:10:47,863
If I don't succeed-

162
00:10:47,863 --> 00:10:52,432
Hang on a second! Why are you telling me all this now?!

163
00:10:52,432 --> 00:10:55,778
Because, it looks like the Metal Breath chose you, sir.

164
00:10:55,778 --> 00:10:57,831
What? Metal Breath?

165
00:10:57,831 --> 00:11:01,581
The Metal Breath can only be possessed by the chosen one.

166
00:11:01,581 --> 00:11:05,509
The one who holds the Metal Breath will become the king, the ruler, of all Metal Cardbots.

167
00:11:05,509 --> 00:11:06,918
K-king?

168
00:11:06,918 --> 00:11:10,534
Uh! Pardon my mistake. I mean... the boss? The master?

169
00:11:10,534 --> 00:11:12,966
So, you mean... someone important?

170
00:11:12,966 --> 00:11:14,682
Yes sir! That's correct.

171
00:11:14,682 --> 00:11:18,364
No way! I've never been hall monitor or anything!

172
00:11:18,364 --> 00:11:22,211
Excuse me. Would you please lend me your powers, sir?

173
00:11:22,211 --> 00:11:25,259
Hmm... alright!

174
00:11:25,259 --> 00:11:26,698
On one condition, though!

175
00:11:26,698 --> 00:11:28,340
Yes, sir?

176
00:11:28,340 --> 00:11:30,975
My name is Jun Grant! Call me Jun, not sir!

177
00:11:31,174 --> 00:11:32,759
Yes, Jun!

178
00:11:32,759 --> 00:11:34,153
And one more thing!

179
00:11:35,254 --> 00:11:39,365
My BMX that your friend crashed! I'll need to be compensated for that!
