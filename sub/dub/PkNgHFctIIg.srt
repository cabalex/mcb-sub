00:00:01,624 --> 00:00:04,380
Guardian of the Forest

2
00:00:11,878 --> 00:00:14,676
Watch this explosion of art, haha!

3
00:00:18,782 --> 00:00:21,737
Hahaha! Something exploded, alright!

4
00:00:21,775 --> 00:00:22,603
What did you say?!

5
00:00:22,603 --> 00:00:23,643
Oh, I said nothing...

6
00:00:23,643 --> 00:00:25,546
Get out of here right now...

7
00:00:26,28 --> 00:00:27,438
It wasn't me!

8
00:00:27,438 --> 00:00:29,552
I said, get out!

9
00:00:29,737 --> 00:00:32,323
W-what was that?!

10
00:00:34,836 --> 00:00:35,751
V-Vance!

11
00:00:37,836 --> 00:00:39,923
Aaah!

12
00:00:40,938 --> 00:00:44,555
Hahaha! A monster?!

13
00:00:44,555 --> 00:00:46,197
You expect us to believe that?!

14
00:00:46,197 --> 00:00:47,948
We really saw it, guys!

15
00:00:47,948 --> 00:00:50,181
It had a long neck, sharp teeth, and he said

16
00:00:50,181 --> 00:00:53,989
"Get out of this forest! Do it now!"

17
00:00:53,989 --> 00:00:56,216
The monster could even talk?

18
00:00:56,216 --> 00:00:58,33
No, no way...

19
00:00:58,33 --> 00:01:01,406
You better hurry home today so you don't see it again!

20
00:01:01,406 --> 00:01:03,392
I swear it's true!

21
00:01:03,392 --> 00:01:05,60
What do they mean by monsters?

22
00:01:05,60 --> 00:01:07,459
I'd make up a more believable story if I were them...

23
00:01:07,459 --> 00:01:09,793
You mean... like robots from space... right?

24
00:01:10,673 --> 00:01:12,287
Crest?!

25
00:01:12,287 --> 00:01:14,976
W-well, what do you mean "robots", Crest?

26
00:01:14,976 --> 00:01:17,708
Y-yeah, w-what do you mean by that?

27
00:01:17,708 --> 00:01:20,744
Seems there's so many strange things happening in this town.

28
00:01:20,744 --> 00:01:25,151
There might be something to Vance's story, don't you agree with me?

29
00:01:25,151 --> 00:01:30,511
There's been a series of accidents taking place in the new highway being constructed in the north of Mowtown.

30
00:01:30,511 --> 00:01:34,59
All the workers on-site said the exact same thing.

31
00:01:34,59 --> 00:01:36,713
That a giant monster appeared from behind the fog.

32
00:01:36,713 --> 00:01:38,446
What?!

33
00:01:38,446 --> 00:01:40,551
Don't you think it should be checked out?

34
00:02:00,256 --> 00:02:02,49
Waaah!!

35
00:02:04,241 --> 00:02:06,718
You mean... there are monsters like that on Earth?!

36
00:02:06,718 --> 00:02:10,488
There weren't any monsters like that on Machina planet!

37
00:02:10,488 --> 00:02:14,804
Don't worry... that's only a movie, guys.

38
00:02:14,804 --> 00:02:16,507
Nah, come on. I knew it wasn't real.

39
00:02:16,507 --> 00:02:17,548
Blue Cop!

40
00:02:18,208 --> 00:02:18,973
Jun.

41
00:02:19,496 --> 00:02:21,179
Let's go monster hunting!

42
00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:22,969
What?! A monster?!

43
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:26,48
You're joking, right?!

44
00:02:26,48 --> 00:02:26,425
Huh?

45
00:02:26,425 --> 00:02:27,905
I'm not going near any monster!

46
00:02:27,905 --> 00:02:29,720
What's wrong?

47
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:30,639
No idea.

48
00:02:36,468 --> 00:02:40,8
So you think the monster behind the rumors could actually be a Metal Cardbot.

49
00:02:40,8 --> 00:02:42,811
That seems to be the most likely story.

50
00:02:42,811 --> 00:02:46,692
I wonder how much Crest knows about the Metal Cardbots...

51
00:02:46,692 --> 00:02:48,321
Let's not worry about that.

52
00:02:48,321 --> 00:02:50,774
We need to focus on finding the monster first.

53
00:02:50,774 --> 00:02:52,910
Okay... we're here.

54
00:02:55,56 --> 00:02:56,47
Crest!

55
00:02:56,47 --> 00:02:58,225
Hey guys. I was waiting for you.

56
00:02:58,225 --> 00:02:59,429
Yeah. Let's go.

57
00:03:01,828 --> 00:03:03,631
That's... some bad art.

58
00:03:03,631 --> 00:03:05,260
Looks like Vance.

59
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:07,172
Be careful, master.

60
00:03:13,873 --> 00:03:16,621
Can we just stand here without permission?

61
00:03:16,621 --> 00:03:21,434
Construction has been suspended since the accidents. All that remains is...

62
00:03:22,678 --> 00:03:23,849
Waah!

63
00:03:24,93 --> 00:03:26,260
Wildlife. Like that raccoon.

64
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:32,245
Lots of animals in this area...

65
00:03:32,245 --> 00:03:34,450
There were many around the repair shop too.

66
00:03:34,450 --> 00:03:37,733
They disappeared when development projects took place in the area.

67
00:03:37,733 --> 00:03:42,44
Hey, look over there!

68
00:03:42,44 --> 00:03:43,355
Is that a footprint?

69
00:03:43,355 --> 00:03:44,512
It's huge!

70
00:03:44,512 --> 00:03:45,990
Probably not an animal...

71
00:03:45,990 --> 00:03:48,328
About 12 meters in height.

72
00:03:48,328 --> 00:03:50,996
Bigger than the robot we saw last time.

73
00:03:51,706 --> 00:03:54,473
You can't say for sure it was a robot...

74
00:03:54,473 --> 00:03:58,435
Yeah! It could be a conspiracy trying to cover up what's going on!

75
00:03:58,435 --> 00:04:00,599
Not a conspiracy theory now.

76
00:04:03,4 --> 00:04:05,769
Watch out, Jun. It's close.

77
00:04:06,199 --> 00:04:08,314
Get out right now!

78
00:04:09,298 --> 00:04:10,530
What's that?

79
00:04:10,530 --> 00:04:12,796
Get out right now!

80
00:04:20,893 --> 00:04:22,194
Where did it come from?!

81
00:04:24,608 --> 00:04:28,164
Get out of this forest...

82
00:04:28,164 --> 00:04:29,904
...right now!!

83
00:04:30,90 --> 00:04:32,607
It's a monster!!

84
00:04:33,451 --> 00:04:34,510
Who are you?!

85
00:04:37,404 --> 00:04:39,33
An excavator?

86
00:04:39,33 --> 00:04:40,625
Careful, Jun. That's a...

87
00:04:40,625 --> 00:04:44,433
I said, get out! Didn't you hear me?!

88
00:04:44,433 --> 00:04:47,68
Waah!!

89
00:04:51,792 --> 00:04:53,493
Let's hide under there!

90
00:04:53,493 --> 00:04:54,847
One, two! One, two!

91
00:04:58,20 --> 00:04:59,382
Edo, hurry!

92
00:05:03,539 --> 00:05:04,478
I can't get in!

93
00:05:04,478 --> 00:05:06,189
That's what happens when you have all those muscles!

94
00:05:08,370 --> 00:05:09,261
Over there!

95
00:05:17,957 --> 00:05:21,218
I told you to get out... right now!

96
00:05:29,478 --> 00:05:30,350
Take that!

97
00:05:32,638 --> 00:05:33,906
No, Edo!

98
00:05:38,563 --> 00:05:39,733
Uncle Edo!

99
00:05:42,526 --> 00:05:44,794
The monster was indeed a Metal Cardbot...

100
00:05:44,794 --> 00:05:47,979
...what do I do? I can't summon them with Crest around...

101
00:05:47,979 --> 00:05:49,395
Let go of him!

102
00:05:50,406 --> 00:05:52,11
Wait a moment, Crest!

103
00:05:52,11 --> 00:05:53,470
Hey!

104
00:05:53,570 --> 00:05:55,539
Why are you chasing people away?

105
00:05:57,129 --> 00:05:59,4
I don't like humans.

106
00:05:59,4 --> 00:06:00,322
What is the problem?

107
00:06:00,322 --> 00:06:02,745
You really don't know?

108
00:06:02,745 --> 00:06:05,237
They're all destroying the forest.

109
00:06:05,237 --> 00:06:09,820
Every time the humans expand the roads, creatures of the forest lose their home.

110
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:10,983
That's the problem.

111
00:06:10,983 --> 00:06:14,234
You threaten people pretending to be a monster and destroyed the construction site?

112
00:06:14,234 --> 00:06:16,707
Yeah. Got a problem?

113
00:06:16,707 --> 00:06:19,565
A true guardian this forest has, huh...

114
00:06:19,565 --> 00:06:21,815
Using violence to oppress others?

115
00:06:21,815 --> 00:06:25,91
Isn't it the same thing as what these humans you hate are doing?

116
00:06:28,299 --> 00:06:28,979
Shut up!

117
00:06:29,28 --> 00:06:30,627
Waah!

118
00:06:30,627 --> 00:06:31,709
Uncle Edo!

119
00:06:31,709 --> 00:06:36,569
You fools! You don't even know how many forest creatures have been sacrificed

120
00:06:36,569 --> 00:06:38,343
because of humans!

121
00:06:55,970 --> 00:06:56,777
Crest!

122
00:06:59,34 --> 00:07:00,146
Crest!

123
00:07:00,442 --> 00:07:02,686
Don't worry about me. Just run!

124
00:07:02,686 --> 00:07:04,570
You know I wouldn't do that!

125
00:07:05,581 --> 00:07:07,248
Jun?! Are you going to show him?!

126
00:07:07,248 --> 00:07:09,255
The secret of the Metal Cardbots?!

127
00:07:09,466 --> 00:07:11,181
Metal Cardbot, pickup!

128
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:25,205
Is that...

129
00:07:25,205 --> 00:07:26,465
Wild Guardy!

130
00:07:26,708 --> 00:07:28,292
You all better run!

131
00:07:29,849 --> 00:07:31,900
Guys! Please take care of Crest!

132
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:32,743
Got it!

133
00:07:34,439 --> 00:07:36,336
Crest, are you okay?!

134
00:07:36,531 --> 00:07:38,569
I-I think I can walk...

135
00:07:38,569 --> 00:07:40,57
Hold on us tight!

136
00:07:41,885 --> 00:07:44,7
How about me, guys...

137
00:07:44,7 --> 00:07:45,486
Waah!

138
00:07:47,339 --> 00:07:48,300
You?

139
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:50,160
You injured a human being?

140
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:52,414
You are a disgrace to the Metal Cardbots!

141
00:07:55,61 --> 00:07:57,101
Oh!

142
00:07:57,101 --> 00:07:59,790
Master Crest! How did this happen?!

143
00:07:59,790 --> 00:08:01,289
Are you okay?

144
00:08:01,289 --> 00:08:03,888
I tried to be careful, I swear...

145
00:08:03,888 --> 00:08:04,768
Crest! Oh no!

146
00:08:04,768 --> 00:08:05,280
Oh!

147
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:07,407
Master Crest, sir!

148
00:08:10,545 --> 00:08:13,39
...I can't see anything!

149
00:08:13,39 --> 00:08:14,764
Be prepared, Dexter.

150
00:08:14,764 --> 00:08:16,921
Wild Guardy is here to take you down!

151
00:08:16,921 --> 00:08:18,83
Hold on!

152
00:08:19,873 --> 00:08:23,765
If he hates humans that much, he won't open up to us right now no matter what we do!

153
00:08:23,765 --> 00:08:25,518
Please, leave it to us!

154
00:08:25,518 --> 00:08:26,934
You said... us?

155
00:08:33,564 --> 00:08:35,240
Metal Breath, pickup!

156
00:08:36,973 --> 00:08:38,555
Blue Cop, setup!

157
00:08:46,709 --> 00:08:50,40
Out of my way, Blue Cop! Dexter is mine to punish.

158
00:08:50,40 --> 00:08:53,944
Wild Guardy, can't you see? That doesn't solve anything.

159
00:08:53,944 --> 00:08:56,269
That's none of my business.

160
00:08:56,269 --> 00:08:58,708
That pile of metal hurt my friend!

161
00:08:58,708 --> 00:08:59,684
What?!

162
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:05,715
You can't run away from me!

163
00:09:08,851 --> 00:09:09,694
Stop it!

164
00:09:12,972 --> 00:09:15,944
Don't you dare try to command me!

165
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:21,770
Mega Ambler, it's your turn!

166
00:09:29,882 --> 00:09:32,118
I'll leave it to you, Mega Ambler!

167
00:09:32,118 --> 00:09:33,82
Got it!

168
00:09:33,628 --> 00:09:35,382
You will have to settle things with me!

169
00:09:36,106 --> 00:09:37,376
Out of my way!

170
00:09:39,528 --> 00:09:41,591
W...where is this?

171
00:09:44,624 --> 00:09:45,670
Huh?

172
00:09:54,542 --> 00:09:56,359
Here! Blue Cop!

173
00:09:59,952 --> 00:10:01,336
Dexter! Stop!

174
00:10:03,273 --> 00:10:05,453
Hey! Don't follow me!

175
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:15,284
Blue Cop! Are you alright?

176
00:10:15,957 --> 00:10:18,316
That was a powerful hit...

177
00:10:20,674 --> 00:10:24,747
Blue Cop! Let's use the Infinity Force Break to end this right now!

178
00:10:24,747 --> 00:10:26,892
Infinity... Force Break...

179
00:10:29,528 --> 00:10:31,27
Infinity...

180
00:10:31,27 --> 00:10:32,311
Force...

181
00:10:32,311 --> 00:10:33,738
Break!!

182
00:10:40,193 --> 00:10:44,17
But... if we use it here... the tunnel could collapse.

183
00:10:44,17 --> 00:10:45,585
But... Blue Cop...

184
00:10:46,678 --> 00:10:47,909
Dexter is gone!

185
00:10:47,909 --> 00:10:49,195
Let's go after him!

186
00:10:53,602 --> 00:10:54,637
Woah, careful!

187
00:11:01,858 --> 00:11:02,882
What's this...
