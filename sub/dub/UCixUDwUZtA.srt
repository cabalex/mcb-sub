1
00:00:01,485 --> 00:00:04,953
Black Hook Strikes Back

2
00:00:08,131 --> 00:00:09,102
What is this?

3
00:00:09,102 --> 00:00:11,673
All of these are my inventions.

4
00:00:11,673 --> 00:00:15,919
Buster Gallon, the self proclaimed genius inventor of Machina planet.

5
00:00:15,919 --> 00:00:18,589
"Self proclaimed" was unnecessary...

6
00:00:18,589 --> 00:00:19,527
Is this a pen?

7
00:00:19,527 --> 00:00:23,301
That is a cheat pen which automatically writes the correct answers for you.

8
00:00:23,301 --> 00:00:25,114
With this I could be the top of the cl-

9
00:00:25,114 --> 00:00:26,454
Auckpth!

10
00:00:27,902 --> 00:00:32,473
It's actually a pen that punishes those who want to use it to cheat like that.

11
00:00:32,473 --> 00:00:33,895
And... what's this?

12
00:00:33,895 --> 00:00:37,106
It's a brush that makes your hair beautiful with just one stroke.

13
00:00:37,106 --> 00:00:38,750
Wow, really?

14
00:00:40,168 --> 00:00:42,901
Look, beautiful, isn't it?

15
00:00:42,901 --> 00:00:45,468
These inventions are quite useless...

16
00:00:45,468 --> 00:00:47,271
But aren't they fun?

17
00:00:47,271 --> 00:00:48,509
What do you mean?

18
00:00:48,509 --> 00:00:49,753
What's fun about them!

19
00:00:49,753 --> 00:00:54,948
To me, it's the most fun to see the looks on people's faces after they've been tricked!

20
00:00:54,948 --> 00:00:57,399
Really? That's what you find "fun"?

21
00:00:57,399 --> 00:01:00,159
Should we accept this trickster as our teammate?

22
00:01:00,159 --> 00:01:02,503
I say no! We cannot trust him!

23
00:01:02,503 --> 00:01:03,420
Have to agree.

24
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:05,186
I don't like him either.

25
00:01:05,186 --> 00:01:07,906
No... he will... oh...

26
00:01:07,906 --> 00:01:09,849
I'll trust him!

27
00:01:09,849 --> 00:01:10,442
What?!

28
00:01:10,442 --> 00:01:11,331
Jun?!

29
00:01:11,331 --> 00:01:12,962
Why? He's so fun!

30
00:01:12,962 --> 00:01:15,373
Also, I like to play pranks too, you know?

31
00:01:15,373 --> 00:01:16,480
You're too optimistic.

32
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:20,480
I think it's too hard to trust after you've been betrayed.

33
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:24,593
However... if you keep suspecting someone like that, you can never build trust!

34
00:01:24,593 --> 00:01:26,439
I trust you. Jun.

35
00:01:26,439 --> 00:01:27,198
Cool!

36
00:01:27,198 --> 00:01:30,387
That means you trust me that we can trust Buster Gallon, right?

37
00:01:30,387 --> 00:01:32,719
What does that mean?

38
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:37,539
Anyway! Thank you once again for joining our team, Buster Gallon!

39
00:01:38,868 --> 00:01:39,768
Huh?

40
00:01:39,768 --> 00:01:41,620
What is this?

41
00:01:44,210 --> 00:01:45,487
What's wrong?

42
00:01:45,487 --> 00:01:46,987
[unintelligible]

43
00:01:49,829 --> 00:01:51,652
What's going on?

44
00:01:51,652 --> 00:01:52,579
What's happening?

45
00:01:54,668 --> 00:01:57,378
This doesn't seem like a simple blackout.

46
00:01:57,378 --> 00:02:00,376
The current dropped, but it hasn't stopped completely.

47
00:02:00,376 --> 00:02:02,853
Do you think there could be a problem at the power plant?

48
00:02:02,853 --> 00:02:05,534
Huh? Daddy?! Is that true?!

49
00:02:05,534 --> 00:02:06,968
What is it, Anna?

50
00:02:06,968 --> 00:02:09,626
A strange ship has appeared at Mowtown's electrical facility!

51
00:02:09,626 --> 00:02:10,931
What?! Is it...

52
00:02:10,931 --> 00:02:12,430
It's Black Hook!

53
00:02:17,545 --> 00:02:21,274
Hahahaha! Give me everything!

54
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:26,646
Aah! If we let them, the entire city will come to a standstill!

55
00:02:26,646 --> 00:02:27,800
Let's go! Right now!

56
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:29,319
Got it!

57
00:02:29,319 --> 00:02:30,485
Black Hook...

58
00:02:30,485 --> 00:02:32,278
Everyone, come back!

59
00:02:36,471 --> 00:02:40,432
I'm worried... what is he planning with an attack on the electrical facilities?

60
00:02:40,432 --> 00:02:45,150
Black Hook is trying to absorb all the electricity to power up!

61
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:49,103
Trying to take in all of that energy in one go is typical Black Hook!

62
00:02:52,444 --> 00:02:54,350
I see he's one greedy fella...

63
00:02:54,350 --> 00:02:58,570
He was already powerful before! We'll never beat him if he gets stronger!

64
00:02:59,247 --> 00:03:01,758
Theo! Anna! I have an idea!

65
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:07,377
Yahaha!

66
00:03:07,377 --> 00:03:10,710
I still need more! More! MORE!

67
00:03:18,634 --> 00:03:21,844
Anyone who gets between me and my food will get crushed!

68
00:03:22,765 --> 00:03:23,520
Huh?

69
00:03:24,639 --> 00:03:25,212
What?!

70
00:03:25,950 --> 00:03:27,983
Water Splash!

71
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:32,271
Let's go! Mega Ambler!

72
00:03:36,299 --> 00:03:38,560
Mega Ambler, Forceps Shock!

73
00:03:40,699 --> 00:03:41,209
Forceps Shock!

74
00:03:41,408 --> 00:03:43,271
Stop!

75
00:03:49,844 --> 00:03:50,905
We did it!

76
00:03:50,905 --> 00:03:53,978
Water conducts electricity, just as Jun planned!

77
00:03:53,978 --> 00:03:55,390
Augh, my car...

78
00:03:55,745 --> 00:03:57,685
Not so fast, kiddo!

79
00:04:01,569 --> 00:04:03,509
Guys, come back!

80
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:11,752
Ha! That little plan of yours never had a chance!

81
00:04:11,752 --> 00:04:13,498
Then what about this, huh?

82
00:04:13,498 --> 00:04:14,584
Fleta Z!

83
00:04:16,245 --> 00:04:17,518
Fleta Z, setup!

84
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:23,634
Fleta Z, Beak Arrow!

85
00:04:23,634 --> 00:04:24,740
Beak Arrow!

86
00:04:27,478 --> 00:04:29,860
Not a chance!

87
00:04:29,408 --> 00:04:30,899
Now, Fleta Z!

88
00:04:30,899 --> 00:04:31,487
Yes!

89
00:04:34,379 --> 00:04:36,500
Why isn't it coming out?!

90
00:04:37,769 --> 00:04:39,678
I'm losing energy!

91
00:04:39,678 --> 00:04:41,216
Have you heard of a grounding rod?!

92
00:04:41,216 --> 00:04:45,711
It's a safety device that sends electricity from washing machines and fridges into the ground!

93
00:04:45,711 --> 00:04:49,492
Now all your energy will be absorbed by the ground!

94
00:04:49,492 --> 00:04:50,324
We did it!

95
00:04:50,324 --> 00:04:51,572
That's our Jun!

96
00:04:51,904 --> 00:04:54,302
All thanks to you guys!

97
00:04:54,302 --> 00:04:55,691
Why, you little...

98
00:04:57,552 --> 00:04:59,262
I'll share something with you!

99
00:05:00,778 --> 00:05:02,252
Fleta Z, come back!

100
00:05:03,557 --> 00:05:06,220
You brats are getting on my nerves!

101
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:07,555
You will be punished!

102
00:05:07,555 --> 00:05:09,194
Mega Trucker, setup!

103
00:05:10,430 --> 00:05:11,685
Shoulder Shield!

104
00:05:14,259 --> 00:05:16,286
How long do you think you can last with that?!

105
00:05:19,572 --> 00:05:21,483
He's too strong for Mega Trucker!

106
00:05:21,483 --> 00:05:26,656
Yes. We all have to get together!

107
00:05:26,656 --> 00:05:28,423
We're here to help!

108
00:05:28,423 --> 00:05:30,766
Oh! It's been a while!

109
00:05:30,766 --> 00:05:32,832
Buffalo Crush! Buster Gallon!

110
00:05:32,832 --> 00:05:34,187
You're helping too, right?

111
00:05:34,909 --> 00:05:36,738
I guess there's no choice.

112
00:05:36,738 --> 00:05:38,625
Buffalo Crush is helping too!

113
00:05:40,430 --> 00:05:43,189
After turning against me, cretins!

114
00:05:43,189 --> 00:05:47,946
You sold your soul to that Earthling kiddo, and now you will strike me?!

115
00:05:47,946 --> 00:05:51,266
I, Buffalo Crush, never sold my soul to anyone!

116
00:05:51,266 --> 00:05:51,824
What?!

117
00:05:52,516 --> 00:05:55,377
Machina planet is now gone.

118
00:05:55,377 --> 00:05:58,430
We have to live on planet Earth.

119
00:05:58,430 --> 00:06:00,100
You. Me. Everyone!

120
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:01,475
Shut up!

121
00:06:02,141 --> 00:06:03,449
Oh no!

122
00:06:03,449 --> 00:06:06,232
After spending all that energy, he can still use his lethal weapon?!

123
00:06:07,235 --> 00:06:08,935
Everyone, concentrate on the shield!

124
00:06:08,935 --> 00:06:10,315
Now! Hurry!

125
00:06:10,315 --> 00:06:11,692
No! We don't have time!

126
00:06:13,978 --> 00:06:16,879
Captain's Cannon!

127
00:06:26,148 --> 00:06:30,519
Oh dear. I've never been one to lose my cool,

128
00:06:30,519 --> 00:06:32,406
but I almost ended up destroying the Metal Breath!

129
00:06:33,153 --> 00:06:36,249
Oh no! Everyone, are you alright?!

130
00:06:36,249 --> 00:06:39,391
Now! You are the only ones who remain.

131
00:06:39,391 --> 00:06:40,853
Run away, Jun!

132
00:06:46,237 --> 00:06:47,399
I can't do that!

133
00:06:48,730 --> 00:06:52,798
I will never leave my friends behind like that! Never!

134
00:06:52,798 --> 00:06:53,776
You hear me?!

135
00:07:01,214 --> 00:07:02,312
What's that light...?

136
00:07:02,721 --> 00:07:05,404
Could it be? The light of the forbidden power?!

137
00:07:05,404 --> 00:07:07,189
The forbidden power...?

138
00:07:07,189 --> 00:07:09,690
A legendary force in Machina planet!

139
00:07:09,690 --> 00:07:12,553
Too huge that it had to be sealed away!

140
00:07:12,553 --> 00:07:15,893
So deep, it had been held within the Metal Breath!

141
00:07:15,893 --> 00:07:16,877
Hey, kiddo!

142
00:07:16,877 --> 00:07:20,463
Give it to me right now! Hand me over!

143
00:07:20,463 --> 00:07:22,735
I actually don't know what that is!

144
00:07:22,735 --> 00:07:24,130
But I will never give it to you-

145
00:07:28,338 --> 00:07:30,790
What is he doing?!

146
00:07:30,790 --> 00:07:31,129
Let me go! Drop me!

147
00:07:31,129 --> 00:07:34,461
Buster Gallon... huh?!

148
00:07:34,461 --> 00:07:35,692
Here it is.

149
00:07:35,692 --> 00:07:38,117
It's all yours now. Captain.

150
00:07:38,117 --> 00:07:39,207
He's kidding, right?!

151
00:07:39,207 --> 00:07:40,389
Did he just betray us?!

152
00:07:40,389 --> 00:07:41,697
Oh no...

153
00:07:42,137 --> 00:07:44,716
Well done, Buster Gallon!

154
00:07:44,716 --> 00:07:48,269
You know I always trusted you with my heart.

155
00:07:48,269 --> 00:07:51,913
With this, the universe will be ours! Hahaha!

156
00:07:51,913 --> 00:07:55,812
What did I tell you?! I said we shouldn't have taken him in!

157
00:07:57,278 --> 00:07:58,978
I believe I told you.

158
00:07:58,978 --> 00:08:02,0
It is my greatest joy to see your faces...

159
00:08:02,0 --> 00:08:05,564
...after you've been tricked.

160
00:08:05,564 --> 00:08:06,488
Yes!

161
00:08:06,488 --> 00:08:08,478
This is our last chance!

162
00:08:08,478 --> 00:08:11,108
Ack! What's this?!

163
00:08:11,108 --> 00:08:12,269
I can't see anything!

164
00:08:13,859 --> 00:08:15,346
The time is now, Buster Gallon!

165
00:08:15,346 --> 00:08:16,295
Alright!

166
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:27,490
My energy!! After all this!!

167
00:08:27,781 --> 00:08:29,446
Buster Gallon, setup!

168
00:08:37,638 --> 00:08:39,912
Thank you for believing in me. Captain.

169
00:08:39,912 --> 00:08:42,370
Buster Gallon! Twin Vulcan! (FIX_THIS)

170
00:08:43,913 --> 00:08:45,600
Twin Vulcan!

171
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:48,306
Buster Blaster!

172
00:08:49,639 --> 00:08:50,879
Buster Blaster!

173
00:08:52,363 --> 00:08:55,604
I never thought you would fool me twice!

174
00:08:55,604 --> 00:08:59,515
Looks like I don't deserve to be Captain...!

175
00:08:59,606 --> 00:09:00,792
Jun!

176
00:09:00,792 --> 00:09:01,354
Blue Cop!

177
00:09:09,255 --> 00:09:10,524
Infinity...

178
00:09:10,524 --> 00:09:11,687
Force...

179
00:09:11,687 --> 00:09:13,472
Break!!

180
00:09:29,681 --> 00:09:30,688
That's it!

181
00:09:32,134 --> 00:09:35,212
Metal Cardbot, Change Up!

182
00:09:54,850 --> 00:09:56,624
Black Hook, seal up!

183
00:09:59,135 --> 00:10:00,668
We did it...

184
00:10:01,931 --> 00:10:03,263
We did it, Jun!

185
00:10:04,264 --> 00:10:06,698
I thought we lost for a moment there...

186
00:10:06,698 --> 00:10:09,359
Hey you, Buster Gallon. Who's side are you on?

187
00:10:09,359 --> 00:10:11,600
What do you mean, "who's side"?

188
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:12,446
Don't you act so coy...

189
00:10:12,446 --> 00:10:14,774
Were you thinking of betraying us?

190
00:10:14,774 --> 00:10:17,416
I don't really know. However...

191
00:10:17,416 --> 00:10:18,438
However?

192
00:10:18,438 --> 00:10:20,347
Jun believed in me.

193
00:10:20,347 --> 00:10:23,647
So I started thinking about believing in him too.

194
00:10:23,647 --> 00:10:25,222
Buster Gallon!

195
00:10:25,222 --> 00:10:27,654
Now we are officially a team!

196
00:10:27,654 --> 00:10:28,817
Thank you.

197
00:10:32,639 --> 00:10:33,969
No!! My arm!!

198
00:10:35,431 --> 00:10:37,279
Jun! Are you alright?!

199
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:42,327
Ehehehe! I got you! Haha!

200
00:10:42,327 --> 00:10:44,513
Oh, dear me... you got me this time...

201
00:10:45,644 --> 00:10:47,451
Ugh... really, Jun?

202
00:10:47,451 --> 00:10:50,518
You still have the energy for pranks?

203
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:56,889
Oh... what do I tell the insurance company about this?

204
00:10:56,889 --> 00:11:00,583
Maybe that you made a supreme sacrifice to protect the peace of Mowtown!

205
00:11:00,583 --> 00:11:02,100
That's not gonna work!

206
00:11:02,797 --> 00:11:04,361
It's my dad...

207
00:11:04,361 --> 00:11:05,356
Hello, Daddy!

208
00:11:05,356 --> 00:11:07,418
Why are you calling me?

209
00:11:07,418 --> 00:11:10,388
Anna, tell me. Where are you right now? Are you okay?

210
00:11:10,388 --> 00:11:13,423
Something strange is happening at the landfill.

211
00:11:13,423 --> 00:11:17,735
Look! A huge dome-shaped ore is rising from Landfill 30!

212
00:11:17,735 --> 00:11:20,879
It seems large enough to cover the entire landfill!

213
00:11:20,879 --> 00:11:24,491
Could this mysterious phenomenon be a simple act of nature?!

214
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:27,302
What is that...
