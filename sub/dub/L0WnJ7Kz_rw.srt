1
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:04,860
The Final Battle
The Earth will generate an endless supply of core metal.

2
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:09,381
And I will save our people of steel from the threat of extinction!

3
00:00:09,381 --> 00:00:10,570
Is that your goal?

4
00:00:10,864 --> 00:00:14,589
Yes. It is my dream to reconstruct Machina planet!

5
00:00:14,589 --> 00:00:19,103
And you don't care if the people and creatures of this planet disappear for that dream?!

6
00:00:19,103 --> 00:00:23,588
You know there has to be a little sacrifice for a bigger goal!

7
00:00:23,704 --> 00:00:25,0
A little sacrifice...?!

8
00:00:25,0 --> 00:00:25,454
Huh?

9
00:00:25,454 --> 00:00:27,864
We're all doing our best with our lives!

10
00:00:27,864 --> 00:00:30,689
No one should be allowed to put that to an end!

11
00:00:30,689 --> 00:00:31,510
Jun!

12
00:00:31,547 --> 00:00:33,856
No! I will never give up!!

13
00:00:33,856 --> 00:00:36,567
I will make sure to protect my people...

14
00:00:36,567 --> 00:00:37,838
and the Metal Cardbots!

15
00:00:42,533 --> 00:00:44,218
It's happening again...

16
00:00:44,218 --> 00:00:46,326
Jun! Unleash the forbidden power!

17
00:00:46,326 --> 00:00:47,890
That is the only way to defeat him!

18
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:48,899
Wait!

19
00:00:48,899 --> 00:00:52,353
A power sealed in the Metal Breath could be dangerous for him!

20
00:00:52,353 --> 00:00:53,911
Haha! What do you mean?

21
00:00:53,911 --> 00:00:54,621
Jun!

22
00:00:54,621 --> 00:00:57,954
We have faced together countless ventures... and beat them all!

23
00:00:57,954 --> 00:01:00,868
There is no danger I can't overcome when I'm with you!

24
00:01:02,319 --> 00:01:02,868
Okay.

25
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:04,819
We haven't given up either!

26
00:01:04,819 --> 00:01:05,793
Woah, guys!

27
00:01:06,317 --> 00:01:08,200
There's one last card you can use.

28
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:10,337
You must not forget us!

29
00:01:10,337 --> 00:01:11,414
We're always together!

30
00:01:11,414 --> 00:01:13,176
Yes. The battle starts now!

31
00:01:13,176 --> 00:01:14,391
Let's show the warmth in Jun's heart...

32
00:01:14,391 --> 00:01:16,283
to that big oaf over there!

33
00:01:16,283 --> 00:01:19,277
Jun... Blue Cop... let's use everyone's power!

34
00:01:23,674 --> 00:01:25,628
Oh, wow... look at that!

35
00:01:25,628 --> 00:01:33,319
Jun's spirit and determination to never give up has combined the spirit of the Metal Cardbots to awaken the forbidden power!

36
00:01:34,103 --> 00:01:35,329
Coming together...

37
00:01:35,329 --> 00:01:36,740
...as one spirit!

38
00:01:47,472 --> 00:01:49,786
Ultimate Armour... setup! (FX-ua)

39
00:02:13,521 --> 00:02:16,471
All the power of Machina planet...

40
00:02:16,471 --> 00:02:18,199
was coursing through our veins...

41
00:02:20,865 --> 00:02:22,461
Jun... are you alright?

42
00:02:22,972 --> 00:02:23,913
Mhm!

43
00:02:25,622 --> 00:02:27,631
Let's show everyone!

44
00:02:29,148 --> 00:02:30,991
Edge Acceleration!

45
00:02:35,288 --> 00:02:36,949
That's nothing for us!

46
00:02:36,949 --> 00:02:38,514
Mega Power Shield! (FX-megaTrucker shake bold)

47
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:42,649
Spear Thrust! (FX-dexter shake bold)

48
00:02:47,514 --> 00:02:49,110
Captain's Cannon! (FX-blackHook shake bold)

49
00:02:55,985 --> 00:02:57,545
Continue to push ahead!

50
00:02:57,545 --> 00:02:58,848
Wild Raid! (FX-wildGuardy shake bold)

51
00:03:00,179 --> 00:03:01,139
Not too bad!

52
00:03:03,538 --> 00:03:04,711
Twin Vulcan! (FX-busterGallon shake bold)

53
00:03:06,425 --> 00:03:07,657
Spinning Cutter! (FX-shadowX shake bold)

54
00:03:11,431 --> 00:03:12,816
Forceps Crush! (FX-megaAmbler shake bold)

55
00:03:14,830 --> 00:03:17,252
Buffalo Moonsault! (FX-buffaloCrush shake bold)

56
00:03:20,448 --> 00:03:21,865
Hammer Blaze! (FX-phoenixFire shake bold)

57
00:03:25,670 --> 00:03:27,585
Vulture Wings! (FX-fletaZ shake bold)

58
00:03:29,397 --> 00:03:31,788
Aagh! Not a chance this will work!

59
00:03:31,788 --> 00:03:33,520
We are not done yet!

60
00:03:38,968 --> 00:03:40,152
Lightning... (FX-shake bold)

61
00:03:40,152 --> 00:03:41,280
Over... (FX-shakexl bold)

62
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,930
Strike!! (FX-shakexxl bold ua)

63
00:03:53,149 --> 00:03:54,889
How dare you...

64
00:03:56,307 --> 00:03:58,095
Incredible! This is the forbidden force-

65
00:03:58,095 --> 00:03:58,728
A-aagh! (FX-shake phoenixFire)

66
00:03:59,728 --> 00:04:00,948
Jun! Are you okay?!

67
00:04:01,366 --> 00:04:02,413
I-I'm okay!

68
00:04:02,413 --> 00:04:03,491
Aah! Blue Cop!

69
00:04:04,626 --> 00:04:05,455
Agh!

70
00:04:05,485 --> 00:04:06,467
What is it, Jun?!

71
00:04:07,139 --> 00:04:10,127
The Metal Breath! It's starting to burn me up...!

72
00:04:11,156 --> 00:04:14,217
Is the forbidden power going rogue?! Take off the Metal Breath!

73
00:04:14,217 --> 00:04:15,806
No! We strike back!

74
00:04:17,826 --> 00:04:19,163
Please, Jun!

75
00:04:19,163 --> 00:04:20,156
No, Blue Cop!

76
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:21,903
I can't!

77
00:04:21,903 --> 00:04:23,271
Not until I have him sealed!

78
00:04:23,963 --> 00:04:24,396
But...

79
00:04:24,636 --> 00:04:27,935
If we stop now, everything we did will go to waste!

80
00:04:27,935 --> 00:04:29,293
The way we all met!

81
00:04:29,293 --> 00:04:31,446
The way we became friends!

82
00:04:31,446 --> 00:04:32,980
You know me well!

83
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:34,874
I will never give up!

84
00:04:34,874 --> 00:04:38,752
For a world where humans and Metal Cardbots will live together!

85
00:04:38,752 --> 00:04:40,807
Let's do it, Blue Cop!

86
00:04:44,846 --> 00:04:46,737
Do you think this planet will accept you?!

87
00:04:46,737 --> 00:04:48,120
You're wrong!!

88
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:53,172
This planet will be remade in our image!

89
00:04:53,172 --> 00:04:55,846
You humans will not survive!

90
00:04:55,846 --> 00:04:56,889
No!

91
00:04:56,889 --> 00:04:58,887
Humans will survive no matter what!

92
00:04:58,887 --> 00:05:01,262
Because they have been kind and wise!

93
00:05:01,262 --> 00:05:02,494
And they have accepted us!

94
00:05:02,494 --> 00:05:03,555
Shut up!!

95
00:05:10,523 --> 00:05:12,992
Infinite... (FX-ua shake)

96
00:05:12,992 --> 00:05:14,992
Punish!! (FX-ua shakexxl)

97
00:05:27,754 --> 00:05:29,206
Huh?! Jun!

98
00:05:29,206 --> 00:05:30,273
Hey, guys!

99
00:05:30,862 --> 00:05:32,295
Don't get any closer, please!

100
00:05:32,295 --> 00:05:36,290
Ugh... the Star Crown is still alive...

101
00:05:36,290 --> 00:05:38,572
As long as I have it... my dream will...

102
00:05:38,572 --> 00:05:39,490
Huh...?!

103
00:05:41,415 --> 00:05:42,596
Blue Cop!

104
00:05:42,596 --> 00:05:43,603
Setup!

105
00:05:47,701 --> 00:05:51,229
Seems like... you still haven't learned your lesson.

106
00:05:51,229 --> 00:05:53,918
Heh. Looks like you didn't hear me.

107
00:05:53,918 --> 00:05:55,132
I will never give up!

108
00:05:58,944 --> 00:06:00,572
Infinity...

109
00:06:00,572 --> 00:06:02,317
Force...

110
00:06:05,175 --> 00:06:07,262
Megavolt... (FX-shake)

111
00:06:07,262 --> 00:06:09,139
Punch!! (FX-shakexl blueCop)

112
00:06:09,396 --> 00:06:11,418
Iron Cannon!!

113
00:06:33,903 --> 00:06:35,307
Metal Cardbot...

114
00:06:35,307 --> 00:06:36,675
Change Up!

115
00:06:37,687 --> 00:06:43,417
My dream was to bring back to life my home planet...

116
00:06:43,417 --> 00:06:45,286
Why do you want to stop me...?

117
00:06:45,286 --> 00:06:48,983
Because it is my dream to live together with my friends!

118
00:06:48,983 --> 00:06:51,971
I always wanted to protect my dream too!

119
00:06:51,971 --> 00:06:54,201
I see...

120
00:06:54,201 --> 00:06:56,348
I've been defeated...

121
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:04,100
Heavy Iron...

122
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:04,857
Seal up!

123
00:07:12,156 --> 00:07:13,420
Oh no!

124
00:07:13,420 --> 00:07:15,785
Oh no! What happened to Jun?! And the Metal Cardbots?!

125
00:07:15,785 --> 00:07:18,288
It's all my fault! I should have stopped him!

126
00:07:18,288 --> 00:07:20,485
...can you tell me what happened to Jun?

127
00:07:21,987 --> 00:07:23,853
Jun...

128
00:07:23,853 --> 00:07:25,245
I just can't believe it...

129
00:07:25,245 --> 00:07:26,473
What's wrong, guys?

130
00:07:26,473 --> 00:07:28,826
Well, you see... the thing is that-

131
00:07:28,826 --> 00:07:30,442
What?! Jun?!

132
00:07:30,442 --> 00:07:31,480
You're alright?!

133
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:33,836
All thanks to my good friends!

134
00:07:33,836 --> 00:07:34,637
Blue Cop!

135
00:07:34,637 --> 00:07:37,403
Oh you little- I was so so worried about you!

136
00:07:37,403 --> 00:07:40,997
I thought we lost you over there! Jun!

137
00:07:40,997 --> 00:07:42,490
I'm sorry... but...

138
00:07:42,490 --> 00:07:44,600
Here, take this! I'm back safe and sound.

139
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:45,715
Oh, thank you...

140
00:07:47,899 --> 00:07:48,439
Here you go...

141
00:07:48,439 --> 00:07:48,730
Eugh...

142
00:07:49,278 --> 00:07:50,812
I'm so glad you're okay!

143
00:07:50,812 --> 00:07:52,795
Jun!

144
00:07:52,795 --> 00:07:54,540
What are you doing...?

145
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:57,737
It seems like a brave police officer managed to go inside and rescue the boy.

146
00:07:57,737 --> 00:07:59,542
Please, can I have an interview?

147
00:08:00,495 --> 00:08:05,290
That evening... we were given a huge scolding.

148
00:08:05,290 --> 00:08:06,211
Don't you ever do that again!

149
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:08,189
Huh?

150
00:08:08,189 --> 00:08:09,108
Jun?

151
00:08:10,875 --> 00:08:12,677
Uh, uh... Mom... so... uh-

152
00:08:15,257 --> 00:08:17,305
It didn't hurt too bad, Mom!

153
00:08:17,305 --> 00:08:19,136
I'm sure the scar will be gone in a week!

154
00:08:19,136 --> 00:08:20,271
Listen to me!

155
00:08:20,271 --> 00:08:22,985
I'll never forgive you if you put yourself in danger again!

156
00:08:22,985 --> 00:08:25,170
and I won't let you play with your friends ever again!

157
00:08:25,170 --> 00:08:26,889
What?! That hurt!

158
00:08:26,889 --> 00:08:28,235
That's a little too much!

159
00:08:28,235 --> 00:08:29,754
Hey, Yuri! Please forgive Jun!

160
00:08:29,754 --> 00:08:30,449
Quiet!

161
00:08:30,449 --> 00:08:31,449
...okay...

162
00:08:31,697 --> 00:08:33,625
I'm really sorry.

163
00:08:33,625 --> 00:08:36,158
I know you just wanted to help your friends.

164
00:08:36,158 --> 00:08:38,230
But do you know how worried I was?

165
00:08:38,686 --> 00:08:40,423
I'll never do that again, Mom...

166
00:08:41,709 --> 00:08:43,965
We also took care of the aftermath in secret.

167
00:08:43,965 --> 00:08:50,334
According to Buster Gallon, most of the Machinasium turned into ordinary rock when the Star Crown was destroyed.

168
00:08:50,334 --> 00:08:53,676
However... it seemed like small and dense pieces are still alive.

169
00:08:53,676 --> 00:08:55,619
Ugh. We'll never find all of them!

170
00:08:55,619 --> 00:08:58,312
Shut up! Let's see who can collect the most!

171
00:08:58,312 --> 00:08:59,721
I'm sure I'll win this!

172
00:08:59,721 --> 00:09:01,110
No, you won't!

173
00:09:01,721 --> 00:09:07,238
Vera, who saw what happened that day, seems to believe that the dome was a base for an alien invasion.

174
00:09:07,238 --> 00:09:09,485
Well... she's kinda right!

175
00:09:09,485 --> 00:09:11,514
Ha! I saw it on TV!

176
00:09:11,514 --> 00:09:15,403
It was just a swelling of different underground elements together with methane!

177
00:09:15,403 --> 00:09:16,850
Vance, you're too smart!

178
00:09:16,850 --> 00:09:18,778
You fool! They-

179
00:09:18,778 --> 00:09:19,570
Hello, Vera!

180
00:09:19,570 --> 00:09:20,769
We'll be off then!

181
00:09:20,769 --> 00:09:21,581
Jun! You saw it, didn't you?

182
00:09:21,581 --> 00:09:22,705
Aliens?

183
00:09:22,705 --> 00:09:25,201
They probably exist! Space is huge, right?

184
00:09:25,201 --> 00:09:30,403
According to the Drake equation, there are 25,000 planets in this galaxy with alien lifeforms!

185
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:31,985
Jun! We have a situation!

186
00:09:31,985 --> 00:09:33,388
Huh?! I know that voice!

187
00:09:33,388 --> 00:09:34,600
See you later!

188
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:35,288
Hey, wait!

189
00:09:36,634 --> 00:09:40,244
And now... we are cleaning up the warehouse together!

190
00:09:40,244 --> 00:09:44,836
Since we have some huge guys joining us, we have to get on Edo's good side!

191
00:09:44,836 --> 00:09:48,224
Although... this big guy doesn't seem to have opened up.

192
00:09:49,264 --> 00:09:51,330
This stain's just not getting off...

193
00:09:51,330 --> 00:09:54,450
Disappointing, Blue Cop. I'll get that out!

194
00:09:54,519 --> 00:09:56,345
Why the long face over there?!

195
00:09:56,345 --> 00:09:58,720
Cleaning up after humans? That's a shame.

196
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,460
I can't believe you're doing this.

197
00:10:00,460 --> 00:10:02,697
This is how we clean up on Earth. Why not give it a try?

198
00:10:02,697 --> 00:10:05,360
Do you really think I'll ever stoop that low?

199
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:08,330
Haha! I think he's just bad at it!

200
00:10:08,330 --> 00:10:12,230
Say what?

201
00:10:12,230 --> 00:10:13,187
What a tough stain-

202
00:10:14,442 --> 00:10:17,825
I'll show you that I'm not just good, I'm better than all of you!

203
00:10:18,538 --> 00:10:21,240
Using that much force is not gonna work!

204
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:22,548
Why don't you use this-

205
00:10:22,548 --> 00:10:22,988
Woah, woah!

206
00:10:23,778 --> 00:10:25,961
Fire is the best when it comes to stains! Haha!

207
00:10:25,961 --> 00:10:27,865
Phoenix Fire! We need you here!

208
00:10:27,865 --> 00:10:29,210
Huh?!

209
00:10:29,210 --> 00:10:31,322
No, you troublemakers! What are you up to?!

210
00:10:34,345 --> 00:10:35,341
Ugh...

211
00:10:35,341 --> 00:10:36,969
Jun! We have an emergency!

212
00:10:37,711 --> 00:10:39,894
Let's go, everyone!

213
00:10:41,210 --> 00:10:48,580
You won't get away this time!!

214
00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:51,0
Phew! So we had to run all the way here...

215
00:10:51,0 --> 00:10:54,418
Yeah... and even I've run away with you.

216
00:10:54,418 --> 00:10:57,432
Isn't that proof that you've become our friend?

217
00:10:58,918 --> 00:11:00,745
Look at the sky, Heavy Iron!

218
00:11:00,745 --> 00:11:01,610
Hmm?

219
00:11:01,610 --> 00:11:04,774
Machina planet doesn't exist anymore! So...

220
00:11:04,774 --> 00:11:06,691
you have to live here on Earth with us!

221
00:11:06,691 --> 00:11:07,625
Jun?

222
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:10,370
You know that's a painful thought for him.

223
00:11:10,370 --> 00:11:10,956
But...

224
00:11:11,899 --> 00:11:12,447
Huh?

225
00:11:12,745 --> 00:11:16,932
You never know how many Metal Cardbots are still out there in the stars...

226
00:11:16,932 --> 00:11:19,139
Lost in the vast universe...

227
00:11:19,139 --> 00:11:24,210
Let's make it our role to give them a warm welcome when they arrive here on Earth!

228
00:11:24,210 --> 00:11:28,831
Heavy Iron! Let's create a world where Metal Cardbots and humans can coexist and be friends!

229
00:11:28,831 --> 00:11:29,932
What do you say?

230
00:11:30,634 --> 00:11:33,985
I think... I'm starting to understand you.

231
00:11:34,932 --> 00:11:38,315
Let's work together. For the future of Metal Cardbots.

232
00:11:39,782 --> 00:11:41,729
Thank you, Heavy Iron!

233
00:11:41,903 --> 00:11:43,221
Well done.

234
00:11:43,221 --> 00:11:45,331
So we've made yet another incredible friend.

235
00:11:45,875 --> 00:11:48,230
Can you quit that look in your eyes now?

236
00:11:48,230 --> 00:11:51,163
Hmph.

237
00:11:51,163 --> 00:11:53,517
Woah! Now you look more reasonable!

238
00:11:53,517 --> 00:11:54,767
Right?!

239
00:11:56,134 --> 00:11:57,956
Deus Machina...

240
00:11:57,956 --> 00:11:59,519
Was this the reason...

241
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:01,100
That you chose him?
