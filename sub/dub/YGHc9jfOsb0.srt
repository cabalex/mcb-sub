1
00:00:01,721 --> 00:00:04,727
The Invisible Challenger

2
00:00:07,957 --> 00:00:09,830
You can do it!

3
00:00:16,46 --> 00:00:17,957
Not bad at all...

4
00:00:17,957 --> 00:00:19,52
Let's go, Jun!

5
00:00:19,52 --> 00:00:20,395
You can do it!

6
00:00:24,241 --> 00:00:25,348
Goal!!

7
00:00:25,348 --> 00:00:27,299
Haha! How was that?

8
00:00:27,299 --> 00:00:28,544
But... Jun...!

9
00:00:29,986 --> 00:00:32,39
What the...

10
00:00:33,411 --> 00:00:34,574
Augh!

11
00:00:37,883 --> 00:00:39,956
Jun, are you alright?

12
00:00:46,197 --> 00:00:47,971
Okay, bye!

13
00:00:48,67 --> 00:00:50,333
See you, Anna! Bye!

14
00:00:58,986 --> 00:01:00,157
Jun?

15
00:01:01,399 --> 00:01:03,399
Hey, watch where you're going...

16
00:01:06,115 --> 00:01:07,329
What happened...

17
00:01:13,327 --> 00:01:14,377
What was that...

18
00:01:15,547 --> 00:01:17,778
I don't understand what's going on...

19
00:01:20,412 --> 00:01:21,443
Augh!

20
00:01:23,471 --> 00:01:25,686
Am I under some kind of spell?!

21
00:01:26,697 --> 00:01:29,808
Haha! It looks like you're having a bad luck day.

22
00:01:29,973 --> 00:01:32,34
No, it's not just some bad luck.

23
00:01:32,628 --> 00:01:36,770
I'm sure someone must have put a curse on me or something!

24
00:01:36,883 --> 00:01:38,246
Who could it be?

25
00:01:38,246 --> 00:01:40,711
I wish I knew so I could get my hands on them!

26
00:01:46,378 --> 00:01:48,79
What are you guys on about?

27
00:01:49,329 --> 00:01:51,8
Haha!

28
00:01:51,693 --> 00:01:53,480
What's that on your face?!

29
00:01:54,558 --> 00:01:56,86
What happened to your face?

30
00:01:56,86 --> 00:01:58,337
You're one to talk! Have you seen your reflection?

31
00:01:58,337 --> 00:02:00,199
I would say it's an improvement.

32
00:02:00,199 --> 00:02:01,910
What did you say?!

33
00:02:01,910 --> 00:02:03,285
It was you, right?!

34
00:02:03,285 --> 00:02:04,495
Guys, chill! Chill!

35
00:02:04,495 --> 00:02:05,881
Stop! What are you doing?

36
00:02:10,745 --> 00:02:12,979
Looks like we've all been pranked...

37
00:02:12,979 --> 00:02:15,520
Who could have pulled such a prank...

38
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:16,845
I don't know...

39
00:02:16,845 --> 00:02:20,209
I was just sunbathing in the area while you were in school...

40
00:02:20,209 --> 00:02:23,680
We can get rusty if we just stay in our Metal Card forms...

41
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:27,676
When I woke up, this had happened...

42
00:02:27,676 --> 00:02:31,877
Did kids in the neighborhood pull this as a prank?

43
00:02:31,877 --> 00:02:34,886
It does seem like a childish prank...

44
00:02:34,886 --> 00:02:36,204
Who are you calling childish?!

45
00:02:41,629 --> 00:02:43,40
What's that?!

46
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:45,696
Did it go invisible?

47
00:02:47,844 --> 00:02:49,133
Haha!

48
00:02:51,121 --> 00:02:52,377
Show yourself!

49
00:02:52,377 --> 00:02:54,508
You must be a Metal Cardbot like us!

50
00:02:55,17 --> 00:02:56,961
So you figured out, huh?

51
00:02:57,508 --> 00:02:59,413
Now... stealth mode off!

52
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:02,991
Is it a helicopter?

53
00:03:02,991 --> 00:03:06,169
No, it's a VTOL aircraft. Vertical Take-Off and Landing.

54
00:03:06,169 --> 00:03:08,263
It was camouflaged to blend into its surroundings!

55
00:03:08,263 --> 00:03:12,508
I think there was something like that on Earth. Looks kinda like a lizard?

56
00:03:12,508 --> 00:03:13,596
Chameleon.

57
00:03:13,596 --> 00:03:14,667
Yeah, that's it.

58
00:03:14,667 --> 00:03:17,252
Hey, chameleon helicopter!

59
00:03:17,252 --> 00:03:18,708
Who are you?

60
00:03:19,75 --> 00:03:21,389
You can call me Shadow X.

61
00:03:21,389 --> 00:03:23,415
You drew on their faces, didn't you?!

62
00:03:23,415 --> 00:03:25,565
Yeah, and that's not all!

63
00:03:25,565 --> 00:03:28,37
I was also the one pranking you all day long!

64
00:03:36,782 --> 00:03:38,477
So that was all you!

65
00:03:38,477 --> 00:03:40,75
Why did you do that?

66
00:03:40,75 --> 00:03:41,392
Isn't that obvious?

67
00:03:41,392 --> 00:03:42,320
I. Just.

68
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:42,988
Don't.

69
00:03:42,988 --> 00:03:43,565
Like.

70
00:03:43,565 --> 00:03:44,476
You!

71
00:03:44,476 --> 00:03:46,217
But what do you mean?

72
00:03:46,217 --> 00:03:48,175
I mean, what have I done to you?

73
00:03:48,175 --> 00:03:49,656
What did you do, Jun?

74
00:03:49,656 --> 00:03:51,380
Try to think what it was.

75
00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:54,382
I did nothing! Hrgh...

76
00:03:54,382 --> 00:03:56,533
That's it! The Metal Breath!

77
00:03:56,602 --> 00:04:01,672
You're using that to seal and summon all of us Metal Cardbots,

78
00:04:01,672 --> 00:04:03,872
like you're the boss or something!

79
00:04:03,872 --> 00:04:05,519
I did no such thing!

80
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:08,443
The Metal Breath is the sign of the chosen one,

81
00:04:08,443 --> 00:04:09,702
the one who will lead us.

82
00:04:09,702 --> 00:04:13,914
We need to have Jun to coexist peacefully on planet Earth.

83
00:04:13,914 --> 00:04:14,697
Hmph!

84
00:04:14,697 --> 00:04:17,387
I refuse to submit to this silly kiddo.

85
00:04:17,387 --> 00:04:20,292
I want to fly high in the sky and be free!

86
00:04:20,292 --> 00:04:23,382
Hey, don't call me kiddo, you... chameleon helicopter!

87
00:04:23,382 --> 00:04:25,661
I said my name is Shadow X!

88
00:04:25,661 --> 00:04:28,337
Yeah?? Well, that's a dumb name for a plane!

89
00:04:28,337 --> 00:04:30,438
What, you little runt?!

90
00:04:32,275 --> 00:04:34,43
Like apples and oranges...

91
00:04:34,43 --> 00:04:36,245
They must both be five years old...

92
00:04:36,335 --> 00:04:38,544
You want to have it your way?

93
00:04:38,544 --> 00:04:39,968
Then try to seal me!

94
00:04:39,968 --> 00:04:42,12
Then I'll become your underling!

95
00:04:42,12 --> 00:04:44,786
Like the other Cardbots you have too!

96
00:04:45,747 --> 00:04:48,523
Ugh, here we go again... more trouble...

97
00:04:48,523 --> 00:04:49,974
Blue Cop! Let's get him!

98
00:04:49,974 --> 00:04:51,55
Alright!

99
00:04:51,475 --> 00:04:55,800
How do you plan to catch a plane that can fly and become invisible?!

100
00:04:56,965 --> 00:04:59,7
Hey guys!

101
00:04:59,466 --> 00:05:02,396
I'll show that helicopter what we've got!

102
00:05:16,259 --> 00:05:18,320
Oh... I'm sorry!

103
00:05:18,724 --> 00:05:20,618
Stop, stop, you guys!

104
00:05:20,618 --> 00:05:22,948
Where's your energy?! I need you committed on this!

105
00:05:22,948 --> 00:05:24,812
Sorry, Vera...

106
00:05:24,812 --> 00:05:28,13
My dance videos haven't been getting views at all lately!

107
00:05:28,13 --> 00:05:30,450
Please, can you put some passion in it?!

108
00:05:30,450 --> 00:05:31,704
Yeah, sure...

109
00:05:33,89 --> 00:05:34,394
It's the police!

110
00:05:34,394 --> 00:05:37,846
We aren't allowed to be here! Let's get out before we get scolded!

111
00:05:37,846 --> 00:05:40,175
Hang on. I feel like something's not right.

112
00:05:40,175 --> 00:05:41,811
Hey! Vera!

113
00:05:47,102 --> 00:05:48,816
It's gone up that building!

114
00:05:51,389 --> 00:05:54,360
We need to get Shadow X to come down!

115
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:59,522
Ha! Took you a while to get here!

116
00:05:59,522 --> 00:06:01,855
You're so slow! I was getting bored!

117
00:06:01,855 --> 00:06:02,778
Hey, you...

118
00:06:02,778 --> 00:06:04,538
Blue Cop! Prepare for battle!

119
00:06:04,538 --> 00:06:05,552
Alright.

120
00:06:10,850 --> 00:06:12,354
Metal Breath, pickup!

121
00:06:14,589 --> 00:06:16,543
Blue Cop, setup!

122
00:06:37,812 --> 00:06:40,656
I really hate it when you give commands like that to everyone!

123
00:06:40,656 --> 00:06:43,7
Like, you call the shots here!

124
00:06:43,7 --> 00:06:45,242
Hey, seriously, what did I do?

125
00:06:45,242 --> 00:06:47,369
Quiet now, you blue haired child!

126
00:06:49,330 --> 00:06:52,115
Ha...! Spinning Cutter!

127
00:06:54,15 --> 00:06:55,289
It's a shuriken!

128
00:06:55,289 --> 00:06:56,974
Blue Cop! Burst Shot!

129
00:06:58,333 --> 00:06:59,755
Burst Shot!

130
00:07:02,594 --> 00:07:04,227
Great job, Blue Cop!

131
00:07:04,227 --> 00:07:04,971
One more shot!

132
00:07:06,322 --> 00:07:07,976
Stealth mode, on!

133
00:07:09,325 --> 00:07:10,902
Where did he go?

134
00:07:10,902 --> 00:07:13,141
It's more like a spy than a chameleon...

135
00:07:13,197 --> 00:07:15,32
Where did he go...

136
00:07:16,662 --> 00:07:18,323
Haha! Yaah!

137
00:07:20,612 --> 00:07:25,18
Oh, look out! Don't get distracted there! Haha!

138
00:07:25,724 --> 00:07:27,798
That kid over there... is that Jun?

139
00:07:27,798 --> 00:07:28,397
I think he is!

140
00:07:28,397 --> 00:07:30,249
Is Theo there too?

141
00:07:30,249 --> 00:07:33,300
Hey, what's that robot doing? A strange dance or what?

142
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:34,773
Quick, get that on video!

143
00:07:34,773 --> 00:07:36,37
Alright!

144
00:07:36,788 --> 00:07:39,784
That sure is going to get some views...

145
00:07:41,664 --> 00:07:45,544
Hahaha! Why don't you look where you're going?

146
00:07:55,716 --> 00:07:56,781
Blue Cop!

147
00:08:06,204 --> 00:08:08,530
Megavolt...

148
00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:10,452
Punch!!

149
00:08:12,405 --> 00:08:13,738
Aah!

150
00:08:16,309 --> 00:08:18,866
I don't get it... how did you find me?!

151
00:08:18,866 --> 00:08:22,213
You only hide yourself by blending into your surroundings.

152
00:08:22,213 --> 00:08:25,85
But hey, looks like you cannot hide your shadow!

153
00:08:25,85 --> 00:08:30,329
Huh? So you think you have won already? Stealth mode, on!

154
00:08:32,70 --> 00:08:34,499
Huh...? Aah!

155
00:08:34,872 --> 00:08:37,619
Blue Cop! Thunderbolt Smash!

156
00:08:38,481 --> 00:08:41,376
Thunderbolt...

157
00:08:41,376 --> 00:08:42,930
Smash!!

158
00:08:46,662 --> 00:08:48,189
What's that?!

159
00:08:52,616 --> 00:08:53,835
What is this wind??

160
00:08:53,835 --> 00:08:55,823
Oh, my phone!

161
00:08:56,377 --> 00:08:57,855
Watch out!

162
00:09:00,989 --> 00:09:02,308
Haha!

163
00:09:03,464 --> 00:09:05,329
Blue Cop! Are you alright?

164
00:09:05,329 --> 00:09:06,924
Yeah, I'm okay.

165
00:09:06,961 --> 00:09:10,519
Hey hey! Don't push yourself too hard.

166
00:09:10,519 --> 00:09:12,682
I think we better take over, Jun!

167
00:09:12,682 --> 00:09:15,873
Not a chance! Heli-Tornado!!

168
00:09:20,454 --> 00:09:21,563
Blue Cop!

169
00:09:21,563 --> 00:09:23,90
Don't worry!

170
00:09:23,369 --> 00:09:25,851
How long do you think you'll last?!

171
00:09:34,684 --> 00:09:35,918
Blue Cop!

172
00:09:37,938 --> 00:09:43,435
Haha! Looks like I have won, blue-haired kiddo!

173
00:09:43,435 --> 00:09:46,722
What a pity I couldn't become your underling...

174
00:09:46,722 --> 00:09:48,987
You keep saying underling...

175
00:09:48,987 --> 00:09:52,509
but I have never made any Metal Cardbot my underling!

176
00:09:52,509 --> 00:09:56,310
After acting so high and mighty, I don't need your excuses!

177
00:09:56,310 --> 00:10:01,180
Well, you go first! Is this kiddo our boss or what?

178
00:10:01,377 --> 00:10:04,51
Jun is to us Metal Cardbots...

179
00:10:04,51 --> 00:10:06,593
A friend!

180
00:10:06,593 --> 00:10:09,181
...A...friend?! I don't get it!

181
00:10:09,181 --> 00:10:12,57
What is that? What in the world are you saying!?

182
00:10:12,57 --> 00:10:14,242
If you don't know, I'll tell you!

183
00:10:14,242 --> 00:10:16,385
But only if you can defeat us!

184
00:10:16,385 --> 00:10:17,689
What?

185
00:10:17,689 --> 00:10:20,17
Let's do a rematch, Shadow X!

186
00:10:20,17 --> 00:10:22,348
I promise I will seal you for sure!

187
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:27,380
Next time we meet, you are the one that I hit with the Heli-Tornado!

188
00:10:27,380 --> 00:10:31,295
I have a secret weapon that can beat that, alright?!

189
00:10:31,295 --> 00:10:33,914
Huh? A secret weapon?!

190
00:10:36,856 --> 00:10:39,699
I-I'll take you on!

191
00:10:39,699 --> 00:10:41,836
Next time we meet, we will see if your secret weapon

192
00:10:41,836 --> 00:10:43,992
can beat my Heli-Tornado!

193
00:10:43,992 --> 00:10:47,181
I'm not leaving because I'm scared of some "secret weapon".

194
00:10:47,181 --> 00:10:49,504
Don't get all cocky!

195
00:10:53,238 --> 00:10:54,200
Jun!

196
00:10:54,516 --> 00:10:58,211
You alright? What is this secret weapon...

197
00:10:58,268 --> 00:11:00,617
I also want to know what that is.

198
00:11:00,816 --> 00:11:03,45
It's actually...
