1
00:00:01,857 --> 00:00:05,111
Farewell, Blue Cop

2
00:00:07,314 --> 00:00:10,719
You can summon Mega Trucker any time you want with that card,

3
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:12,555
and you can give him commands, too.

4
00:00:12,555 --> 00:00:14,854
Huh? What's going on? What happened here?!

5
00:00:14,854 --> 00:00:16,33
Huh???

6
00:00:16,33 --> 00:00:17,862
Uh, hello Edo...

7
00:00:22,966 --> 00:00:24,657
Stay away from Jun!

8
00:00:25,295 --> 00:00:26,548
Uh, sir!

9
00:00:27,270 --> 00:00:29,159
Edo, were you at the repair shop?!

10
00:00:29,159 --> 00:00:34,937
I dozed off while working late... then I woke up when I heard loud noises outside!

11
00:00:34,937 --> 00:00:37,496
It was you! You were the one who broke my fence!

12
00:00:37,496 --> 00:00:40,171
And totally crushed Jun's bike!

13
00:00:40,171 --> 00:00:42,297
Aah, Edo, that's not what happened!

14
00:00:42,297 --> 00:00:43,575
It's a misunderstanding, I-

15
00:00:43,575 --> 00:00:45,181
Don't come any closer!

16
00:00:53,110 --> 00:00:54,386
What are you doing, sir?

17
00:00:54,386 --> 00:00:57,216
I'm going to get you, you heap of scrap metal!

18
00:00:59,367 --> 00:01:01,623
Please stop, sir, this is not safe!

19
00:01:01,623 --> 00:01:03,155
What did you say?!

20
00:01:03,155 --> 00:01:07,947
Please stop! Blue Cop is not a heap of scrap metal!

21
00:01:07,947 --> 00:01:09,610
He's from some planet...

22
00:01:09,610 --> 00:01:13,279
I am a Metal Cardbot. A mechanical lifeform from planet Machina.

23
00:01:13,279 --> 00:01:14,415
Right, that one!

24
00:01:14,415 --> 00:01:17,230
Why are you here? Are you trying to bait us or something?!

25
00:01:17,230 --> 00:01:19,169
No no no, sir! We are...

26
00:01:20,826 --> 00:01:22,546
Hey, who are you calling, Edo?

27
00:01:22,546 --> 00:01:25,889
I'm calling the cops, why? Do you think the army should be handling this?

28
00:01:25,889 --> 00:01:28,457
T-that's not a good idea, sir!

29
00:01:28,457 --> 00:01:29,859
Please, stop him, Blue Cop!

30
00:01:29,859 --> 00:01:30,388
Yes.

31
00:01:31,418 --> 00:01:33,509
Uh, hello? Is this the army headquarters-

32
00:01:33,509 --> 00:01:34,532
Waah!

33
00:01:36,305 --> 00:01:41,456
Let me go! You're trying to get rid of me to shut me up, aren't you?!

34
00:01:45,442 --> 00:01:48,386
We have to stop this misunderstanding somehow.

35
00:01:48,386 --> 00:01:50,122
What should I do?

36
00:01:50,122 --> 00:01:53,462
Just untie me already... my shoulders are killing me!

37
00:01:53,462 --> 00:01:55,713
Blue Cop. Do something about his shoulders.

38
00:01:55,713 --> 00:01:56,951
His shoulders?

39
00:01:56,951 --> 00:02:00,450
Yes! Show him you're not a bad robot after all.

40
00:02:13,986 --> 00:02:19,980
I heard on the radio that delivering a vibration of 3200 rotations per second helps blood circulation and relaxes the muscle.

41
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:20,685
Woah!

42
00:02:22,669 --> 00:02:26,288
Ohh... that's good... that's the spot. Try to really get in there...

43
00:02:33,401 --> 00:02:35,105
Ugh...

44
00:02:35,338 --> 00:02:37,0
Are you alright?

45
00:02:37,0 --> 00:02:41,558
No, I'm not... I'm hurting and I'm thirsty... make me a coffee, would you?

46
00:02:42,425 --> 00:02:43,617
Yes, sir.

47
00:02:48,564 --> 00:02:50,418
So you can make coffee!

48
00:02:50,418 --> 00:02:52,577
It's a basic skill for surviving on planet Earth.

49
00:02:52,577 --> 00:02:55,72
White sugar and no cream, okay?

50
00:02:55,72 --> 00:02:56,342
Yes, sir!

51
00:03:03,328 --> 00:03:05,133
Here you are.

52
00:03:12,530 --> 00:03:13,460
Augh, why is it so sweet?!

53
00:03:15,189 --> 00:03:17,409
By white sugar, did you mean... one cube?

54
00:03:17,409 --> 00:03:19,875
You're trying to give me diabetes, huh?!

55
00:03:23,632 --> 00:03:26,111
Where are you going, Edo?

56
00:03:26,111 --> 00:03:30,81
To work. I have a meeting with a partner in the morning, actually.

57
00:03:30,81 --> 00:03:35,314
And you! You better be sure to get this mess cleaned up while I am gone!

58
00:03:37,651 --> 00:03:42,279
Hey, kiddo! You look like you need help. Want a hand?

59
00:03:42,279 --> 00:03:43,657
This voice is from...

60
00:03:43,657 --> 00:03:45,358
Mega Trucker?

61
00:03:45,358 --> 00:03:47,670
Jun! Let's summon Mega Trucker!

62
00:03:47,670 --> 00:03:50,132
Summon? You mean... bring him back here?

63
00:03:50,132 --> 00:03:55,38
Yes. A Metal Cardbot that has been sealed must obey the master.

64
00:03:55,38 --> 00:03:56,427
Don't worry about it.

65
00:03:59,567 --> 00:04:01,592
Alright, I'll give it a shot.

66
00:04:02,408 --> 00:04:03,655
Metal Breath, pickup!

67
00:04:05,434 --> 00:04:07,278
Mega Trucker, setup!

68
00:04:12,831 --> 00:04:15,796
Hmm... such delicate work is my specialty.

69
00:04:15,796 --> 00:04:17,872
Are you sure you can do it?

70
00:04:17,872 --> 00:04:20,523
Leave it to me. Cue the music!

71
00:04:30,675 --> 00:04:32,878
Mega Trucker, you're doing great!

72
00:04:33,621 --> 00:04:35,739
Just getting started!

73
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:41,863
Woohoo!

74
00:04:43,591 --> 00:04:45,96
Stop!

75
00:04:48,361 --> 00:04:50,734
You're getting in my way! This is my favorite part!

76
00:04:53,807 --> 00:04:56,850
Woohoo!

77
00:05:00,879 --> 00:05:04,590
Aah! Both of you, stop! Stop fighting and start getting along!

78
00:05:04,985 --> 00:05:07,751
...did you guys finish cleaning-

79
00:05:13,273 --> 00:05:14,988
What is this?!

80
00:05:18,8 --> 00:05:19,957
What in the world is this?

81
00:05:19,957 --> 00:05:21,901
We... are very sorry.

82
00:05:23,422 --> 00:05:25,907
Oh, that's right! My meeting is starting soon.

83
00:05:25,907 --> 00:05:27,185
I can't waste any more time.

84
00:05:28,277 --> 00:05:30,606
Don't get into any more trouble while I am gone.

85
00:05:34,684 --> 00:05:36,501
Jun, don't you have to go to school too?

86
00:05:36,501 --> 00:05:38,185
O-Oh, that's right!

87
00:05:42,31 --> 00:05:43,933
Why is everything getting in my way!?

88
00:05:45,896 --> 00:05:48,596
Looks like you need some help with that, Edo!

89
00:05:48,596 --> 00:05:51,666
Blue Cop! Here's a job for you!

90
00:06:01,401 --> 00:06:03,840
So you can transform into a car...

91
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:04,555
Yes.

92
00:06:05,249 --> 00:06:09,216
Wait... are all these cars your bodies?

93
00:06:09,809 --> 00:06:10,959
Huh?

94
00:06:17,391 --> 00:06:19,452
There's a bad traffic jam.

95
00:06:19,452 --> 00:06:21,236
Augh, but I'm in a hurry!

96
00:06:21,236 --> 00:06:22,497
I'll try my best.

97
00:06:22,497 --> 00:06:24,553
Hey, what are you going to do?

98
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:31,784
Woah, you're going too fast!

99
00:06:39,292 --> 00:06:40,838
Oh my God!

100
00:06:43,787 --> 00:06:45,411
Hang on, stop the car!

101
00:06:45,411 --> 00:06:47,40
Come on, I said stop!

102
00:06:54,314 --> 00:06:57,663
Police car sirens should only be used in serious situations!

103
00:06:57,663 --> 00:06:59,416
This wasn't one! And you!

104
00:06:59,416 --> 00:07:02,604
You aren't even a real police car!

105
00:07:02,604 --> 00:07:03,526
...I'm sorry, sir.

106
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:09,427
Hmm... I have... something important to discuss.

107
00:07:16,336 --> 00:07:18,907
Edo! I'm back!

108
00:07:18,907 --> 00:07:20,827
Oh, Jun! What's up?

109
00:07:20,827 --> 00:07:23,248
Were you able to make it to the meeting?

110
00:07:23,248 --> 00:07:25,741
Uhh... sure.

111
00:07:25,741 --> 00:07:27,243
What about Blue Cop?

112
00:07:27,243 --> 00:07:29,433
Just... forget about that robot.

113
00:07:29,433 --> 00:07:31,291
What do you mean?

114
00:07:33,927 --> 00:07:37,536
I promise not to tell anyone about you. In return, you must leave.

115
00:07:37,536 --> 00:07:41,671
I can't do that! As you know, Jun has the Metal Breath, sir. Without Jun-

116
00:07:41,671 --> 00:07:48,31
That's not my problem at all! If something happens to Jun, how will I explain that to his parents?

117
00:07:48,31 --> 00:07:50,538
So, you should leave. Go back to your planet!

118
00:07:59,365 --> 00:08:00,876
Edo, how could you be so dumb?!

119
00:08:00,876 --> 00:08:02,237
Huh? What do you mean?

120
00:08:02,237 --> 00:08:07,256
Machina planet was blown up by an explosion! Blue Cop has no home to return to, Edo!

121
00:08:07,256 --> 00:08:08,790
Huh... what?!

122
00:08:13,420 --> 00:08:16,875
Why didn't he tell me he had no home to go back to?!

123
00:08:18,976 --> 00:08:22,189
That truck seems to be a little wobbly, isn't it?

124
00:08:22,432 --> 00:08:23,446
Coming through, sir!

125
00:08:29,608 --> 00:08:30,774
Ugh...

126
00:08:43,771 --> 00:08:46,275
That's the wobbling truck!

127
00:08:46,275 --> 00:08:48,341
Oh dear... was the driver dozing off?

128
00:08:53,259 --> 00:08:56,225
Oh no! We must alert the train, quick!

129
00:08:57,336 --> 00:08:59,994
Blue Cop... where are you now...

130
00:09:04,723 --> 00:09:07,645
You wouldn't mind me using the siren now, would you?

131
00:09:07,645 --> 00:09:08,671
Blue Cop!

132
00:09:09,456 --> 00:09:11,223
Yes! Give me a command, now!

133
00:09:11,914 --> 00:09:14,388
Yes! We gotta push that truck away from the crossing!

134
00:09:17,871 --> 00:09:20,890
Hey, stop there! Please stop! C'mon, please stop!

135
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:37,88
This won't do. I'm not strong enough on my own.

136
00:09:37,88 --> 00:09:39,174
Hey, Jun!

137
00:09:39,174 --> 00:09:40,616
Mega Trucker!

138
00:09:40,616 --> 00:09:42,646
Looks like an emergency. Need my help?

139
00:09:42,646 --> 00:09:44,438
I surely do!

140
00:09:45,35 --> 00:09:46,636
Metal Breath, pickup!

141
00:09:48,528 --> 00:09:49,850
Mega Trucker, setup!

142
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:56,90
Scoot over. I'll help you with that!

143
00:10:05,928 --> 00:10:07,110
Just a little bit more!

144
00:10:11,566 --> 00:10:12,358
Now!

145
00:10:34,731 --> 00:10:40,324
So you spent thousands of years wandering through space until you finally landed on Earth?!

146
00:10:40,975 --> 00:10:44,308
Okay... from now on, planet Earth will be your new home.

147
00:10:44,308 --> 00:10:45,368
Really?

148
00:10:45,368 --> 00:10:48,449
I'm sure we will need your help in the future.

149
00:10:48,449 --> 00:10:50,895
Don't worry, I'll take care of you guys!

150
00:10:51,224 --> 00:10:53,61
Planet Earth is...

151
00:10:53,61 --> 00:10:54,734
...our new home?

152
00:10:56,485 --> 00:10:58,873
Here, you can use these, Edo!

153
00:11:02,689 --> 00:11:05,182
Eugh...
