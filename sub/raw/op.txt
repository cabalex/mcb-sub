Let's go find the cards to the end of this road
Together we'll go find them all
Shout out
"Go Metal Cardbot, go!" (Let's go!)
That Metal Breath will help us do it all
You and I, let's join forces
Battle! Let's move ahead
No one can stop us if we stick together
With our courage and our strength
With Metal Breath we'll go
Collect all the cards
From here till the end
Let's go find the cards to the end of this road
Together we can find them all
Shout out
"Go Metal Cardbot, go!" (Let's go!)
That Metal Breath will help us do it all
(Let's go!)
Metal Cardbot, go
