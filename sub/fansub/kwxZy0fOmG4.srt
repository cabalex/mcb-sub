1
00:00:01,894 --> 00:00:05,477
The Second Metal Card!

2
00:00:05,776 --> 00:00:10,53
Wuh- W-what is this?!

3
00:00:10,253 --> 00:00:13,15
This power...?

4
00:00:13,15 --> 00:00:15,968
I don't really get it... But this is awesome!

5
00:00:20,936 --> 00:00:23,301
Blue Cop's Metal Card!

6
00:00:23,301 --> 00:00:29,490
Tch. I dunno what kind of trick you're trying to pull, but I'll turn you into a heap of scrap right away!

7
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:30,277
Blue Cop!

8
00:00:31,29 --> 00:00:32,934
Blue Cop S! Set up!

9
00:00:51,878 --> 00:00:54,209
Crimson Shoot!

10
00:00:54,248 --> 00:00:55,511
Blow it away!

11
00:01:00,758 --> 00:01:03,284
He parried my Crimson Shoot so easily...!

12
00:01:03,284 --> 00:01:06,561
In that case, I'll just have to kick him myself!

13
00:01:06,561 --> 00:01:08,66
Blue Cop! Take him down!

14
00:01:17,564 --> 00:01:18,496
Blue Cop!

15
00:01:23,412 --> 00:01:26,101
Blue Cop! Star Rising Shot!

16
00:01:26,254 --> 00:01:28,359
Star Rising Shot!

17
00:01:33,311 --> 00:01:40,379
Is this the power of a Star Guardian? Fine! I'm done playing nice too!

18
00:01:40,379 --> 00:01:42,154
He's about to use another skill.

19
00:01:42,154 --> 00:01:42,971
Not gonna happen!

20
00:01:43,467 --> 00:01:45,180
Mega Crimson-

21
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:49,716
Blue Cop! Meteor Bolt Punch!

22
00:01:52,559 --> 00:01:53,987
Kic--huh?!

23
00:01:54,517 --> 00:01:59,148
Meteor Bolt... Punch!!

24
00:02:00,754 --> 00:02:03,619
Wh-waiwaiwaiwaiwait-Argh!!

25
00:02:15,261 --> 00:02:17,06
So, how is it when you use it?

26
00:02:17,06 --> 00:02:20,497
Oh, well, it's almost the same as the one I was using.

27
00:02:20,497 --> 00:02:21,883
Time to finish the job! 

28
00:02:22,102 --> 00:02:23,760
Metal Cardbot, Change Up-

29
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,768
You think you can seal me?!

30
00:02:27,170 --> 00:02:30,5
See ya' later, Blue Hair! Bye-bye!

31
00:02:33,215 --> 00:02:34,250
He got away.

32
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:35,158
Darn it!

33
00:02:35,967 --> 00:02:38,172
Shall we talk about this?

34
00:02:40,129 --> 00:02:42,316
Alright. But let's go somewhere else first.

35
00:02:42,316 --> 00:02:44,538
This is exclusive!

36
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:49,10
My name is Peruru. A caretaker of the Porcaca ruins.

37
00:02:49,10 --> 00:02:50,28
A caretaker?

38
00:02:50,28 --> 00:02:53,623
In my village, it is said it's where the souls of giants from the sea of stars are asleep.

39
00:02:53,623 --> 00:02:54,896
Giants from the sea of stars?

40
00:02:54,896 --> 00:02:59,685
Ah! Giants must mean Metal Cardbots, and the souls are the Metal Cards. Which means...

41
00:03:02,851 --> 00:03:05,462
She's talking about that stone tablet I brought here?

42
00:03:06,2 --> 00:03:08,691
I knew it! So it was you!

43
00:03:08,691 --> 00:03:11,506
Wait, calm down!
And put that down first, please!

44
00:03:11,506 --> 00:03:13,439
Let's calm down and talk about this, shall we?

45
00:03:13,439 --> 00:03:19,151
There was nothing left in the ruins when Master Crest paid a visit! Everything was already stolen!

46
00:03:19,151 --> 00:03:21,736
Then what about that stone tablet, the Metal Card of Red Blitz?

47
00:03:21,736 --> 00:03:26,86
We bought it from a local tour guide! He said it's a valuable item that is very hard to come by...

48
00:03:26,86 --> 00:03:27,298
What was his name?

49
00:03:27,298 --> 00:03:28,454
Araclahn.

50
00:03:28,454 --> 00:03:33,172
Ugh. That guy's a famous black market dealer! You've been deceived!

51
00:03:34,192 --> 00:03:35,745
I'm sorry.

52
00:03:37,565 --> 00:03:41,674
You don't have to apologize. But first, I'd like you guys to help me.

53
00:03:48,863 --> 00:03:54,597
A total of four Metal Cards were stolen from the Porcaca ruins, and this is one of them.

54
00:03:55,266 --> 00:03:58,641
Ooh. It looks just like the one we saw yesterday.

55
00:03:58,641 --> 00:03:59,825
Oh no, please don't do that!

56
00:03:59,825 --> 00:04:02,154
What will you do if it wakes up?

57
00:04:02,154 --> 00:04:04,893
We should take it out of here before that happens.

58
00:04:04,893 --> 00:04:05,734
But how?

59
00:04:05,734 --> 00:04:08,843
How about setting off a smoke bomb to cause a commotion?

60
00:04:08,843 --> 00:04:09,554
(Fire!!)

61
00:04:10,873 --> 00:04:13,338
You're trying to sneak the tablet away in the midst of confusion, right?

62
00:04:13,338 --> 00:04:15,642
I already asked uncle Edo to bring a smoke bomb here!

63
00:04:15,642 --> 00:04:21,46
This museum has a total of 188 video surveillance cameras. It's impossible to sneak away unseen.

64
00:04:21,46 --> 00:04:23,132
Then we'll have to take it by force!

65
00:04:23,132 --> 00:04:24,549
(Stick em' up! Gimme' everything you got!!)

66
00:04:25,191 --> 00:04:26,538
I'm against it.

67
00:04:26,538 --> 00:04:28,449
Think about this more seriously!

68
00:04:28,449 --> 00:04:30,27
Anna?

69
00:04:30,27 --> 00:04:32,900
Huh? Dad! What are you doing here?

70
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:36,978
I came to talk with the museum director about a new exhibit. What about you, Anna?

71
00:04:36,978 --> 00:04:40,641
Ah well... We're trying to find a way to steal that stone tablet behind u-

72
00:04:42,252 --> 00:04:43,626
Why are you telling him that?!

73
00:04:43,626 --> 00:04:46,259
I can't lie to my dad!

74
00:04:46,259 --> 00:04:48,154
Are you in charge here?

75
00:04:48,154 --> 00:04:52,173
Hmm. This is a municipal museum, so you could say that.

76
00:04:52,173 --> 00:04:54,935
This relic belongs to Porcaca village! Give it back!

77
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:58,985
You can't just demand him like that...

78
00:04:58,985 --> 00:05:01,256
If we don't explain it properly, he's going to misunderstand.

79
00:05:01,256 --> 00:05:03,146
Jun. Something is coming.

80
00:05:03,146 --> 00:05:04,152
What?

81
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,423
What is that?

82
00:05:10,423 --> 00:05:11,140
That's-

83
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:12,346
We need to clear out!

84
00:05:16,876 --> 00:05:20,182
I found it! A Metal Card! Hehe.

85
00:05:20,182 --> 00:05:21,937
Anna, are you alright?

86
00:05:21,937 --> 00:05:22,568
Red Blitz!

87
00:05:22,568 --> 00:05:24,167
Why does he look unscathed?!

88
00:05:24,167 --> 00:05:26,427
We cannot let him take it!

89
00:05:26,427 --> 00:05:27,501
Huh?
Sebastian!

90
00:05:27,501 --> 00:05:29,675
Huh? What was that?

91
00:05:29,675 --> 00:05:30,477
Good job!

92
00:05:30,477 --> 00:05:31,604
Now let's get out of here!

93
00:05:34,111 --> 00:05:36,255
Argh, that dang tin can!

94
00:05:39,739 --> 00:05:40,895
You're unharmed, right?

95
00:05:40,895 --> 00:05:41,782
Yes, dad.

96
00:05:41,982 --> 00:05:46,66
Why did he suddenly ask me to bring a smoke bomb anyway? Huh?

97
00:05:46,66 --> 00:05:50,34
Ah, Jun! What about-
We're bringing the slate outside! Get ready to flee!

98
00:05:57,1 --> 00:05:59,918
Sebastian! Pass it here! Over here!

99
00:06:13,729 --> 00:06:16,594
That tablet is property of Mowtown. Give it back!

100
00:06:16,594 --> 00:06:19,119
M-m-m-m-Mr. Mayor, it's not like that!

101
00:06:22,306 --> 00:06:23,314
Hand that over!

102
00:06:28,253 --> 00:06:31,3
Red Blitz! Behave and be sealed!

103
00:06:31,3 --> 00:06:33,230
Seal me if you can!

104
00:06:37,367 --> 00:06:38,601
Dad!

105
00:06:39,383 --> 00:06:40,907
Blue Cop, let's chase him down!

106
00:06:40,907 --> 00:06:41,592
Okay!

107
00:06:42,59 --> 00:06:43,497
I'm coming too!

108
00:06:45,646 --> 00:06:47,878
You should stay and watch the museum in place of your father.

109
00:06:48,386 --> 00:06:49,625
Excuse me?!

110
00:06:55,425 --> 00:06:56,601
Again?!

111
00:06:59,898 --> 00:07:02,179
Why is everybody driving at me?!

112
00:07:02,179 --> 00:07:03,860
Because you're driving in the wrong lane!

113
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:05,948
This road is right-hand traffic! Right-hand!

114
00:07:05,948 --> 00:07:07,885
So that's why!

115
00:07:10,514 --> 00:07:12,30
Just a little faster!

116
00:07:12,30 --> 00:07:13,592
This speed is the best I can do.

117
00:07:13,792 --> 00:07:15,593
Jun!
Anna- Ah!

118
00:07:15,593 --> 00:07:16,680
We're busy right now!

119
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:18,705
Why do you decide that?!

120
00:07:18,705 --> 00:07:20,261
What does she have against me?!

121
00:07:20,261 --> 00:07:22,554
Ahaha... sorry, Anna.

122
00:07:22,554 --> 00:07:24,760
Jun, please save my dad!

123
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:25,617
Of course.

124
00:07:25,617 --> 00:07:28,18
Jun! We have a visual on Red Blitz.

125
00:07:28,18 --> 00:07:28,938
All right!

126
00:07:28,938 --> 00:07:30,378
Hang on tight, you two!

127
00:07:31,892 --> 00:07:34,628
You're persistent today, too!

128
00:07:34,628 --> 00:07:36,513
L-l-l-l-l-look out!

129
00:07:36,513 --> 00:07:37,173
Huh?

130
00:07:47,257 --> 00:07:48,996
Commencing emergency ejection!
Huh?

131
00:08:01,410 --> 00:08:03,754
He caught up again! He's really starting to cramp my style- Ow!

132
00:08:06,769 --> 00:08:08,110
Mr. Mayor, are you okay?

133
00:08:08,110 --> 00:08:11,11
Red Blitz, give up and come with us!

134
00:08:11,11 --> 00:08:12,468
Huh? Look!

135
00:08:20,591 --> 00:08:22,248
The tablet awakened!

136
00:08:22,658 --> 00:08:26,148
That's... the champion of the sky... 

137
00:08:26,148 --> 00:08:27,701
Cielo!

138
00:08:34,119 --> 00:08:36,562
Hnnngh. That was a nice nap.

139
00:08:38,408 --> 00:08:39,856
Cielo!

140
00:08:39,856 --> 00:08:40,9
Red Blitz!

141
00:08:42,5 --> 00:08:46,26
Where are we? What happened while I was asleep?

142
00:08:46,26 --> 00:08:48,640
Let's talk after we teach that little runt a lesson.

143
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:49,707
Runt?

144
00:08:50,67 --> 00:08:52,401
He stole our Metal Breath!

145
00:08:53,805 --> 00:08:56,519
OK, situation understood!

146
00:09:05,672 --> 00:09:07,457
Go hide somewhere safe, quickly!

147
00:09:07,457 --> 00:09:08,18
And what about you?

148
00:09:08,18 --> 00:09:10,766
Now, now, let's be quick, Mr. Mayor!

149
00:09:10,766 --> 00:09:12,585
Be careful!

150
00:09:12,585 --> 00:09:14,686
Don't worry about me!
B-but...

151
00:09:16,565 --> 00:09:19,708
Blue Cop! Star Rising Shot!

152
00:09:26,901 --> 00:09:27,938
Too fast...

153
00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:29,731
Now it's my turn.

154
00:09:41,655 --> 00:09:43,748
Skyjet Shot!

155
00:09:44,115 --> 00:09:44,997
Look out!

156
00:09:47,888 --> 00:09:49,455
Where are you looking?

157
00:09:54,825 --> 00:09:58,108
Having trouble paying attention?

158
00:10:00,297 --> 00:10:01,191
Blue Cop!

159
00:10:01,191 --> 00:10:04,918
Both of you, cut it out! Have you forgotten your promise to Mukara?!

160
00:10:04,918 --> 00:10:09,579
What did you say?! How the heck does someone like you know Mukara?!

161
00:10:09,579 --> 00:10:11,670
Leave the kid alone.

162
00:10:12,303 --> 00:10:17,606
Hey, Blue Hair. If you wanna save her, how 'bout making a trade for that Metal Breath?

163
00:10:17,606 --> 00:10:18,812
What?

164
00:10:20,984 --> 00:10:23,277
Throw the Metal Breath in there. Now!

165
00:10:23,277 --> 00:10:26,467
No! I won't forgive you if you do that!

166
00:10:26,467 --> 00:10:27,785
Shut up!
Agh!

167
00:10:28,342 --> 00:10:29,172
I said leave her out of this!

168
00:10:29,172 --> 00:10:30,135
Do it!

169
00:10:30,542 --> 00:10:35,551
Okay, fine! I'll give you what you want, so just let Peruru go!

170
00:10:35,551 --> 00:10:36,697
Don't be an idiot!

171
00:10:36,697 --> 00:10:38,902
Heh, should have tried this in the first place.

172
00:10:38,902 --> 00:10:40,657
Trade on three!

173
00:10:40,657 --> 00:10:41,886
Alright!

174
00:10:41,886 --> 00:10:42,986
One!

175
00:10:42,986 --> 00:10:45,248
Two!

176
00:10:45,248 --> 00:10:46,388
Three!
Three!

177
00:10:54,667 --> 00:10:56,718
What is this?
When did he-?!

178
00:10:56,718 --> 00:10:59,591
Why did he suddenly ask me to bring a smoke bomb anyway? Huh? 

179
00:11:00,486 --> 00:11:02,165
Be careful!

180
00:11:02,165 --> 00:11:03,995
Don't worry about me!

181
00:11:10,214 --> 00:11:12,53
Huh?! No! Don't touch that!

182
00:11:20,53 --> 00:11:23,2
Nooo!!
