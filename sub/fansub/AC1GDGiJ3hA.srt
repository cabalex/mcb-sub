00:00:01,828 --> 00:00:04,993
Exclusive! Steel Interview

2
00:00:08,537 --> 00:00:10,711
Nice to meet you, my new partner.

3
00:00:10,711 --> 00:00:14,999
I bought you on a 48-month installment plan, so let's work together to finally get a scoop!

4
00:00:25,875 --> 00:00:27,536
Wait, is that...?

5
00:00:28,359 --> 00:00:31,335
If my instincts are correct, then that must be...!

6
00:00:43,579 --> 00:00:48,18
Hey you, glasses guy. Fine looking camera you got there. Are you a news reporter or something?

7
00:00:48,18 --> 00:00:51,896
Go grab your boss, and I'll get you a scoop!

8
00:00:51,896 --> 00:00:54,228
A sc... scoop?!

9
00:00:56,673 --> 00:00:58,521
Teacher!

10
00:00:58,856 --> 00:01:02,109
I'm sorry as always. We've been disturbing your work too often.

11
00:01:02,109 --> 00:01:05,364
What do you mean, disturbing? I like the company.

12
00:01:05,364 --> 00:01:09,218
Whenever you're having a hard time, just let me know. I'll be there for you!

13
00:01:09,218 --> 00:01:11,381
Since when did you two become so close?

14
00:01:11,381 --> 00:01:13,742
J-Jun! How long have you been there?

15
00:01:13,742 --> 00:01:14,587
Hello!

16
00:01:14,587 --> 00:01:16,807
We've been at the car center all day...

17
00:01:18,265 --> 00:01:21,944
Did you forget your promise? We need to keep the existence of Metal Cardbots a secret!

18
00:01:21,944 --> 00:01:24,506
Don't worry! We can trust Ms. Mona.

19
00:01:24,506 --> 00:01:26,400
- Teacher! This is a big train!!
- You need to keep this a secret from others, okay?

20
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:27,140
- Teacher! This is a big train!!
- I know that!

21
00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:30,299
Mr. Train, transform into a robot please!

22
00:01:30,299 --> 00:01:31,938
I'm sorry, but I shouldn't.

23
00:01:31,938 --> 00:01:35,728
Pretty please? We won't say anything to the grown-ups!

24
00:01:35,728 --> 00:01:38,813
If it can't be helped. But just this once.

25
00:01:39,271 --> 00:01:40,241
Guys!

26
00:01:52,246 --> 00:01:53,432
Cool!

27
00:01:54,712 --> 00:01:56,251
Uncle Edo!!

28
00:01:56,251 --> 00:01:57,932
Ms. Mona, what's going on?

29
00:01:58,133 --> 00:02:01,135
Kids, how did you all know about this robot?

30
00:02:01,435 --> 00:02:06,718
Got that? The thing about Metal Cardbots is a secret, so don't tell anybody.

31
00:02:06,718 --> 00:02:07,983
I can't tell my mom about them?

32
00:02:07,983 --> 00:02:09,191
Of course not!

33
00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:11,842
It was him all along!

34
00:02:11,842 --> 00:02:15,995
At this rate, it may only be a matter of time before the Metal Cardbots are discovered.

35
00:02:15,995 --> 00:02:17,395
It's already too late.

36
00:02:18,379 --> 00:02:19,049
Crest!

37
00:02:19,252 --> 00:02:20,269
Look at this.

38
00:02:24,454 --> 00:02:30,704
The editor-in-chief of Mowtown Times interviews a Metal Cardbot, a mechanical lifeform from outer space... 

39
00:02:30,704 --> 00:02:32,557
And they're holding a special press conference?!

40
00:02:46,526 --> 00:02:48,360
Aw, yeah. This is what I'm talking about!

41
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:52,497
Today's main character is none other than ME! Spark Bit!

42
00:02:54,268 --> 00:02:58,973
Good work, Jim! With this, the sales of Mowtown Times newspapers will skyrocket!

43
00:02:58,973 --> 00:03:00,979
Th-Thank you...

44
00:03:00,979 --> 00:03:02,609
Daddy, it's about time to start.

45
00:03:02,609 --> 00:03:03,842
Oh, right, right!

46
00:03:03,842 --> 00:03:06,794
Hahaha! I feel amazing!

47
00:03:08,389 --> 00:03:10,198
Acting a bit flashy for a press conference.

48
00:03:10,198 --> 00:03:13,412
My reporter's spirit is burning up! Jun! Let me interview him too!

49
00:03:13,412 --> 00:03:15,310
What are you talking about? We need to stop this!

50
00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:17,192
What are you guys doing here?

51
00:03:17,192 --> 00:03:18,181
W-where did you-?!

52
00:03:18,181 --> 00:03:21,454
You didn't come here to interrupt my dad's interview, right?

53
00:03:21,454 --> 00:03:24,0
Vera, long time no see. How have you been?

54
00:03:24,0 --> 00:03:27,853
Crest! It's been so long! I'm doing great, thanks!

55
00:03:27,853 --> 00:03:31,425
I came here because I found the article in your newspaper interesting. If you wouldn't mind, could I get a seat?

56
00:03:31,425 --> 00:03:35,360
Of course you can! I've got the best spot. Let's watch it together!

57
00:03:36,956 --> 00:03:38,425
Now's our chance. Let's go!

58
00:03:39,413 --> 00:03:46,134
Alright, then... Greetings, everyone. This is Warren Williams, the editor-in-chief of the Mowtown Times. We've got a great crowd here. 

59
00:03:46,134 --> 00:03:51,643
We're going to have an exclusive interview with a special guest. First, could you tell us your name?

60
00:03:52,643 --> 00:03:59,125
Listen up! My name is Spark Bit, I'm a Metal Cardbot- a mechanical lifeform from the planet Machina.

61
00:03:59,125 --> 00:04:02,592
There are many more Metal Cardbots other than me hiding out on Earth.

62
00:04:02,592 --> 00:04:04,860
And one of them is a Star Guardian!

63
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:11,217
One who would pose as a defender of justice on my home planet of Machina, and now he's here on Earth!

64
00:04:11,217 --> 00:04:14,478
Star Guardian, show yourself! I'll crush you!

65
00:04:14,478 --> 00:04:19,341
Spark Bit deserves to lead the Metal Cardbots on Earth!

66
00:04:19,341 --> 00:04:20,992
Are the Hidden Cardbots starting a rebellion?

67
00:04:20,992 --> 00:04:21,927
We have to do something.

68
00:04:21,927 --> 00:04:24,281
Jun, let me handle this.

69
00:04:24,281 --> 00:04:25,723
Deep Bite...

70
00:04:27,090 --> 00:04:28,675
Okay. The stage is yours!

71
00:04:31,718 --> 00:04:33,494
Deep Bite! Set Up!

72
00:04:43,115 --> 00:04:47,196
Trident... Submarine!

73
00:04:47,531 --> 00:04:49,220
- If what you're saying is true, then this is a historical moment!

74
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:50,483
- If what you're saying is true, then this is a historical moment!
- Hmm? What's that?

75
00:04:50,483 --> 00:04:53,545
- If what you're saying is true, then this is a historical moment!

76
00:04:59,689 --> 00:05:00,269
A shark!

77
00:05:01,177 --> 00:05:02,817
Run for your lives!!

78
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,668
Hey, hey! Wait!

79
00:05:08,908 --> 00:05:10,478
Deep Bite! Take Back!

80
00:05:10,966 --> 00:05:12,333
Alright. And now...

81
00:05:12,333 --> 00:05:15,119
Jun. He wants to fight me. I'll go.

82
00:05:15,119 --> 00:05:18,228
Nuh-uh! You sit this one out! Let me at him!

83
00:05:18,228 --> 00:05:21,560
Okay, Red Blitz! First, let's lure him out of town!

84
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:23,437
We'll take care of things here.

85
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:28,735
What the heck just happened? Who was that Metal Cardbot?

86
00:05:29,935 --> 00:05:31,471
Hey, you cocky punk!

87
00:05:31,471 --> 00:05:33,800
Some nerve, trying to pick a fight with a Star Guardian!

88
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:39,360
Heh! I don't know who you are, but I guess I'll have to teach you some manners... 

89
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:40,319
Little boy!

90
00:05:40,319 --> 00:05:41,225
Little boy?!

91
00:05:41,615 --> 00:05:43,920
Just try me, if you think you can keep up!

92
00:05:45,261 --> 00:05:47,528
You wanna play tag, huh?!

93
00:05:56,774 --> 00:05:58,663
He'll catch up at this rate!

94
00:05:58,663 --> 00:06:01,250
Then let's blow him away!

95
00:06:08,841 --> 00:06:10,446
What, did he run away?

96
00:06:18,427 --> 00:06:20,411
Spark Bit! It's a head-to-head match!

97
00:06:20,411 --> 00:06:23,978
A head-to-head match? Heh! That's my favorite kind of match!

98
00:06:23,978 --> 00:06:26,774
Just don't cry when I beat you! Jun!

99
00:06:27,675 --> 00:06:29,716
Red Blitz! Set Up!

100
00:06:41,951 --> 00:06:45,449
Oh, you fight with your feet! Interesting. 

101
00:06:46,610 --> 00:06:48,634
My fists versus your legs.

102
00:06:49,701 --> 00:06:53,350
Let me teach you... which pair is stronger!

103
00:06:53,350 --> 00:06:57,384
This guy must be a power type. Dragging him into a speed fight will give you an advantage!

104
00:06:57,384 --> 00:06:58,283
Alright!

105
00:07:04,889 --> 00:07:08,120
You're too slow! You won't leave a scratch on me at this rate!

106
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:08,911
You little-!

107
00:07:12,548 --> 00:07:14,884
What, so you're all bark and no bite?

108
00:07:15,449 --> 00:07:16,480
Watch your mouth!

109
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:19,805
Calm down, Red Blitz! You're faster than him. You've got the whole ring.

110
00:07:19,805 --> 00:07:22,329
Float like a butterfly, sting like a bee!

111
00:07:23,677 --> 00:07:26,194
Alright then. Let's float!

112
00:07:26,194 --> 00:07:28,194
I already told you, you're too slow!

113
00:07:29,550 --> 00:07:30,331
Eh?

114
00:07:30,331 --> 00:07:31,737
Giving up already?

115
00:07:35,901 --> 00:07:37,557
Wh-What are you doing?

116
00:07:40,136 --> 00:07:41,163
Now!

117
00:07:46,103 --> 00:07:49,629
Heh! Why don't you tell me again who's too slow?

118
00:07:50,649 --> 00:07:54,199
Don't act so tough when your kicks don't even have a hint of weight to 'em!

119
00:07:54,199 --> 00:07:56,913
Let me show you a real attack!

120
00:07:56,913 --> 00:08:00,807
Oho, you want some more, huh? Jun!

121
00:08:01,507 --> 00:08:04,834
Red Blitz! Mega Crimson Kick!

122
00:08:04,834 --> 00:08:06,956
Mega Crimson...!

123
00:08:07,757 --> 00:08:10,396
Sparking Force...

124
00:08:11,295 --> 00:08:12,822
Knuckle!

125
00:08:13,122 --> 00:08:16,324
-Kick!! H-huh?! I can't move!

126
00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:18,961
What's that..? 

127
00:08:19,588 --> 00:08:21,244
Red Blitz! Behind you!

128
00:08:21,244 --> 00:08:22,740
What?

129
00:08:31,682 --> 00:08:34,667
(What was that? Something doesn't feel right...)

130
00:08:34,667 --> 00:08:36,754
No way he got me with those weak fists...

131
00:08:36,754 --> 00:08:38,312
Come back, Red Blitz!

132
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:40,110
W-What?

133
00:08:40,865 --> 00:08:45,310
Rock Crush! Use your ultrasonic sensor to scan above that container!

134
00:08:45,010 --> 00:08:46,220
O-okay!

135
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:48,489
Who's that bot over there?

136
00:08:48,489 --> 00:08:49,624
I knew it!

137
00:08:50,450 --> 00:08:52,613
You've seen through my stealth mode.

138
00:08:52,613 --> 00:08:53,754
He's got company.

139
00:08:53,754 --> 00:08:56,873
What? Flash Vector? How long have you been here, big bro?

140
00:08:56,873 --> 00:08:57,662
Big bro??

141
00:08:57,662 --> 00:09:01,173
I've been watching you from the start. You're reckless, after all.

142
00:09:03,173 --> 00:09:08,349
I know I can be! But you shouldn't come off as cooler than I am- Uh, wait a minute. Does that mean... 

143
00:09:08,349 --> 00:09:10,451
The reason why that red guy was immobilized is 'cause-

144
00:09:10,451 --> 00:09:11,514
Silence.

145
00:09:11,514 --> 00:09:15,580
Do not forget our goal, Spark Bit. Our target is the Star Guardian.

146
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:18,364
Boy. I know you're with him.

147
00:09:18,364 --> 00:09:19,408
Wait, really?

148
00:09:19,408 --> 00:09:20,974
You've already been told this before!

149
00:09:20,974 --> 00:09:23,701
So that's how he pulled those Metal Cardbots in and out.

150
00:09:23,701 --> 00:09:26,432
Hey, Bluey! Summon the Star Guardian now!

151
00:09:27,190 --> 00:09:29,706
Jun! I'm their target. Let me fight!

152
00:09:29,706 --> 00:09:32,942
But... It's two against one. I know you're strong, Blue Cop, but-

153
00:09:32,942 --> 00:09:35,846
What's the hold up? Backing out because you're afraid?

154
00:09:36,826 --> 00:09:39,716
Jun. Let me and Cielo handle this.

155
00:09:39,716 --> 00:09:43,488
Yeah. We can't just sit still when Red Blitz got beaten up.

156
00:09:44,090 --> 00:09:45,200
Alright.

157
00:09:47,379 --> 00:09:50,918
Who are you guys? Didn't you understand me when I said to summon the Star Guardian?

158
00:09:50,918 --> 00:09:54,557
We don't have to listen to you when we don't even know who you are.

159
00:09:55,557 --> 00:09:58,375
I'm Musclehyde, a former journalist of Cardian's Post.

160
00:09:58,375 --> 00:10:00,687
I'd like to interview the two of you. How does that sound?

161
00:10:00,687 --> 00:10:02,398
I'll let you meet the Star Guardian if you accept.

162
00:10:02,398 --> 00:10:03,894
Huh? Interview?

163
00:10:03,894 --> 00:10:08,302
Ah, Musclehyde is stalling, expecting him to make another fuss for attention.

164
00:10:08,798 --> 00:10:12,971
I refuse! I'm under exclusive contract to the Mowtown Times!

165
00:10:12,971 --> 00:10:14,440
At least he's honest...

166
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:16,647
Declining my interview?

167
00:10:16,969 --> 00:10:17,951
Jun!

168
00:10:18,283 --> 00:10:21,620
Then I'll force you to do an interview!

169
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:22,927
I knew this would happen.

170
00:10:22,927 --> 00:10:24,990
Oh, you want a piece of me too, huh?!

171
00:10:24,990 --> 00:10:26,730
They're a pain in the neck...

172
00:10:26,730 --> 00:10:28,538
We'll finish you off quick then!

173
00:10:32,735 --> 00:10:34,346
Huh? L-look!

174
00:10:42,899 --> 00:10:45,600
That is quite enough, Vector and Bit brothers.

175
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:46,850
Sky Gallop!

176
00:10:46,850 --> 00:10:47,735
Why are you here?!

177
00:10:47,735 --> 00:10:50,474
'Tis only but a matter of alignment with them.

178
00:10:50,474 --> 00:10:53,383
Hey! The fun was just getting started!

179
00:10:53,383 --> 00:10:57,421
Thou pretend thou art not, yet thy wounds from the broil with Sir Crimson Flash left thee impaired.

180
00:10:57,421 --> 00:10:58,466
Wha-?!

181
00:10:58,466 --> 00:11:03,725
The first step to dueling is to be in perfect physical condition. Dost thou agree, Flash Vector?

182
00:11:03,725 --> 00:11:05,600
Mhm. I think so too.

183
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:06,692
What the- Bro!

184
00:11:06,692 --> 00:11:09,485
Tch... aargh!! 

185
00:11:09,485 --> 00:11:13,869
Alright. Fine! But I'll fight you for real next time!

186
00:11:20,822 --> 00:11:24,604
Hey you! Bluey! Tell the Star Guardian that it's his turn next!

187
00:11:24,604 --> 00:11:26,625
He better be prepared for it.

188
00:11:26,923 --> 00:11:29,337
Farewell, master of the Star Guardian.

189
00:11:29,337 --> 00:11:31,354
Send my regards to lady Peruru for me.

190
00:11:32,254 --> 00:11:34,399
Tch. What a let down.

191
00:11:34,605 --> 00:11:38,144
So they were working with Sky Gallop all along...

192
00:11:38,144 --> 00:11:40,384
Hidden Cardbots... We shouldn't let our guard down against them.
