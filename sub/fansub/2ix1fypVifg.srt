00:00:00,850 --> 00:00:03,935
Red Blitz's Sincerity

2
00:00:08,621 --> 00:00:10,253
Gate course settings all clear.

3
00:00:10,253 --> 00:00:12,730
Uhhh, engine internal pressure, all clear! 

4
00:00:12,730 --> 00:00:15,105
W-We're good to go, Captain.

5
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:20,509
From this moment forward, we're taking off in search of a new world.

6
00:00:21,509 --> 00:00:23,931
Speranza! Full speed ahead!

7
00:00:23,931 --> 00:00:25,454
Full speed ahead!

8
00:00:26,155 --> 00:00:28,777
Speranza, departing!

9
00:00:37,328 --> 00:00:41,225
Now, speak out loud! Speak out the words that come to your mind! (FX-mukara voice)

10
00:00:42,112 --> 00:00:44,496
Blue Cop! Superior Docking!

11
00:00:47,185 --> 00:00:50,502
Blue Cop Trinity! Set up! (FX-trinity)

12
00:01:19,375 --> 00:01:21,849
Blue Cop! Show them your power!

13
00:01:22,971 --> 00:01:27,861
Is this... The ultimate power that's been hidden inside Mukara's Metal Breath?!

14
00:01:31,430 --> 00:01:32,406
H-How...

15
00:01:32,406 --> 00:01:33,180
Captain?

16
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:34,799
Guys! Let's get outta here!

17
00:01:35,799 --> 00:01:37,354
Give me back my Metal Breath!

18
00:01:37,354 --> 00:01:38,218
Captain!

19
00:01:41,258 --> 00:01:43,460
Get away from Jun!

20
00:01:43,578 --> 00:01:44,527
Captain!!

21
00:01:46,150 --> 00:01:49,662
Tch, stop being so cocky! All you did was grow a little taller!

22
00:01:55,861 --> 00:02:00,739
Stay back, Red Blitz. This fight is mine!

23
00:02:03,646 --> 00:02:05,742
Blue Cop! Show them your newfound strength!

24
00:02:05,742 --> 00:02:06,659
Roger!

25
00:02:23,853 --> 00:02:25,859
Star Rising Cannon!

26
00:02:28,836 --> 00:02:29,984
Fire!

27
00:02:37,858 --> 00:02:39,134
C-Captain!

28
00:02:40,788 --> 00:02:41,679
REX! (FX-phoenixFire bold xl)

29
00:02:41,679 --> 00:02:42,521
That must be-!

30
00:02:42,521 --> 00:02:43,663
-That flame again!

31
00:02:43,663 --> 00:02:47,152
Not a problem! Nothing can stop Blue Cop now!

32
00:02:47,593 --> 00:02:49,747
INFERNO!! (FX-phoenixFire bold xxl)

33
00:02:50,348 --> 00:02:51,382
Blue Cop!

34
00:02:54,729 --> 00:02:56,674
Supernova Shield! (FX-xl bold blueShine)

35
00:03:04,818 --> 00:03:06,586
How can this be...!

36
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:12,175
Blue Cop! Time to finish this!

37
00:03:30,953 --> 00:03:32,198
Now!

38
00:03:38,299 --> 00:03:41,437
Galaxies Punisher! (FX-xxl bold blueShine)

39
00:04:00,186 --> 00:04:02,306
You've lost, Gigantrex.

40
00:04:03,853 --> 00:04:06,479
Now surrender and be sealed!

41
00:04:06,479 --> 00:04:07,615
Stop it!

42
00:04:08,212 --> 00:04:09,834
Get out of the way, Red Blitz!

43
00:04:09,834 --> 00:04:13,257
No! I will not stand by and watch him be sealed away!

44
00:04:13,257 --> 00:04:14,568
Captain Gigantrex means too much to me... 

45
00:04:14,568 --> 00:04:16,680
'Cause he's my dad!

46
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:17,562
D-

47
00:04:17,562 --> 00:04:18,343
Dad?!

48
00:04:18,343 --> 00:04:20,134
Dad!?!

49
00:04:20,134 --> 00:04:27,213
We were all crew members of the Speranza. We thought our mission was to pioneer a new planet and create a second home. 

50
00:04:27,213 --> 00:04:29,730
Until that day...

51
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:32,331
What just happened? How?!

52
00:04:32,331 --> 00:04:34,250
Something must be wrong!

53
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:36,490
What's all the commotion?

54
00:04:36,521 --> 00:04:39,903
Captain! Planet Machina just... exploded!

55
00:04:39,903 --> 00:04:42,115
What?! What are you trying to say?!

56
00:04:42,115 --> 00:04:46,543
I'm not making this up. I checked again and again and it's all the same. It's even disappeared from the radars!

57
00:04:46,826 --> 00:04:49,615
That doesn't make sense! Check again!

58
00:04:49,615 --> 00:04:53,189
I see... So the time has come.

59
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:54,689
What do you mean, Captain?

60
00:04:54,689 --> 00:04:58,802
Don't tell me... you knew about this? You knew that planet Machina would explode all along?

61
00:04:58,802 --> 00:05:01,379
Deus Machina informed me.

62
00:05:01,379 --> 00:05:04,958
I was told that planet Machina would soon reach the end of its lifespan.

63
00:05:04,958 --> 00:05:07,721
You're lying! Do you actually believe that, Captain?!

64
00:05:07,721 --> 00:05:09,523
We've received an image from a survivor!

65
00:05:11,225 --> 00:05:12,552
You mean...

66
00:05:12,552 --> 00:05:13,879
This is all true?!

67
00:05:15,0 --> 00:05:22,444
The whole pioneering thing was a lie. We came aboard the ship to escape Machina's collapse!

68
00:05:22,444 --> 00:05:24,292
So what's your point?

69
00:05:24,292 --> 00:05:25,329
Crest...

70
00:05:25,329 --> 00:05:31,242
Of all the planets in this vast universe, why did you come to Earth? To make Earth into your new home?

71
00:05:31,242 --> 00:05:31,999
No!

72
00:05:31,999 --> 00:05:34,591
Red Blitz, that's enough.

73
00:05:34,591 --> 00:05:36,574
No! I'll say it! 

74
00:05:36,574 --> 00:05:38,917
The one who crash-landed the Speranza on Earth...

75
00:05:38,917 --> 00:05:39,959
was me!

76
00:05:43,735 --> 00:05:45,817
Boy! What are you doing!?

77
00:05:45,817 --> 00:05:47,685
I'm going back to planet Machina!

78
00:05:47,783 --> 00:05:50,300
What kind of nonsense are you going on about, Red Blitz?!

79
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:52,334
Our planet is long gone!

80
00:05:52,334 --> 00:05:56,269
I'll go back in time! And stop planet Machina...

81
00:05:56,269 --> 00:05:57,968
...from exploding!

82
00:05:58,966 --> 00:06:00,783
Stop this foolishness!

83
00:06:31,980 --> 00:06:36,533
The Speranza then came crashing down to Earth, all because I was being reckless.

84
00:06:36,533 --> 00:06:42,939
You mean the giants from the sea of stars went back in time to Earth as it was 4,000 years ago?

85
00:06:42,939 --> 00:06:47,209
That's impossible! Einstein's Theory of Special Relativity says that the speed of light can't be surpassed!

86
00:06:47,209 --> 00:06:51,816
But with the technology of planet Machina, it's not so far-fetched.

87
00:06:51,816 --> 00:06:56,300
I don't really know what you're talking about, but... come live on Earth with us!

88
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:57,144
What?

89
00:06:57,144 --> 00:07:03,591
You said that your spaceship sank into the ocean. Then we just have to salvage and fix it, right?

90
00:07:03,591 --> 00:07:04,708
Not this again...

91
00:07:04,708 --> 00:07:05,930
You're being too optimistic...

92
00:07:05,930 --> 00:07:12,343
It's not a problem. In those 4,000 years you've been asleep, humans on Earth have come a really long way.

93
00:07:12,343 --> 00:07:15,355
We've been faithful to the dreams you entrusted to us.

94
00:07:15,757 --> 00:07:19,170
Yes. We might be able to bring that spaceship up to the surface if we can find where it is.

95
00:07:19,170 --> 00:07:19,973
Really?!

96
00:07:19,973 --> 00:07:25,348
Of course! Crest is super duper rich and super duper handsome!

97
00:07:25,348 --> 00:07:27,362
It has nothing to do with my looks, though...

98
00:07:27,362 --> 00:07:32,278
I agree with Jun's plan. Our friends must be waiting for us in the Speranza, after all. 

99
00:07:33,177 --> 00:07:35,595
Isn't that right, Red Blitz?

100
00:07:35,595 --> 00:07:37,661
See? You can put your faith in us.

101
00:07:45,379 --> 00:07:47,718
Gotcha! I finally got a scoop!

102
00:07:48,911 --> 00:07:49,619
Captain!

103
00:07:50,189 --> 00:07:51,689
How can we trust you...

104
00:07:51,689 --> 00:07:54,010
You HUMANS! (FX-youHumans)

105
00:07:54,793 --> 00:07:56,161
Captain! No!!

106
00:08:01,761 --> 00:08:03,105
Come back, Musclehyde!

107
00:08:03,838 --> 00:08:06,369
Figured as much. The Captain's condition is too severe.

108
00:08:06,369 --> 00:08:08,653
Blue Cop! Slash his tires!

109
00:08:08,653 --> 00:08:09,620
Roger!

110
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:16,459
Don't you dare lay a finger on my Captain!!

111
00:08:18,728 --> 00:08:20,781
Then we'll deal with you first!

112
00:08:22,891 --> 00:08:24,137
Dad...

113
00:08:26,389 --> 00:08:29,754
You have some nerve in that engine of yours, picking a fight with my Captain.

114
00:08:29,754 --> 00:08:34,216
Shut up! I'm gonna crush you all for sure!

115
00:08:35,109 --> 00:08:39,788
This little guy has a first-rate mill. What's your name?

116
00:08:39,788 --> 00:08:44,447
I am known as the crimson flash, Red Blitz!

117
00:08:44,447 --> 00:08:45,504
Cringe.

118
00:08:46,504 --> 00:08:47,892
I like this boy.

119
00:08:48,302 --> 00:08:53,354
Until the flame in my heart is extinguished, I will defend my Dad!

120
00:08:53,354 --> 00:08:55,605
Crimson Shoot!

121
00:09:04,235 --> 00:09:05,855
Jun! Your Metal Breath!

122
00:09:05,855 --> 00:09:08,413
It must mean we're almost at our limit! Let's finish this quickly!

123
00:09:08,413 --> 00:09:09,100
Roger!

124
00:09:11,370 --> 00:09:14,423
If you don't mind, would you like to come aboard my ship?

125
00:09:14,423 --> 00:09:15,110
Your ship?

126
00:09:15,110 --> 00:09:18,798
Yes. It is a giant ship that sails through the vast ocean of space.

127
00:09:33,721 --> 00:09:37,269
Mega Crimson...

128
00:09:37,269 --> 00:09:38,884
Kick!!

129
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:42,105
Blue Cop! Star Rising Cannon!

130
00:09:58,114 --> 00:09:59,475
Final attack!

131
00:10:03,937 --> 00:10:05,792
DAAAAAD!!

132
00:10:09,393 --> 00:10:13,831
I see. So that means... Gigantrex is like your dad.

133
00:10:13,831 --> 00:10:15,884
What's a dad?

134
00:10:15,884 --> 00:10:22,596
A child is born by the love of their mom and dad. And a dad is someone who watches over their child as they grow up.

135
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:33,158
I made a huge mistake. It's all my fault the Speranza was shipwrecked...

136
00:10:43,754 --> 00:10:46,331
Metal Cardbot! Change up! 

137
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:58,240
It's all my fault the Speranza was shipwrecked...

138
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:02,778
But because of that, we were able to meet like this.

139
00:11:02,778 --> 00:11:05,293
Do you think Gigantrex will look back on this as a mistake?

140
00:11:08,394 --> 00:11:09,572
No, he won't.

141
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:13,854
Red Blitz, sealed!

142
00:11:25,701 --> 00:11:28,557
Who were those two that lent me their strength? 

143
00:11:28,557 --> 00:11:34,403
I don't know. Could it be the power that was hidden in the Metal Breath, just like Ultimate Blue Cop was?

144
00:11:34,403 --> 00:11:37,150
Jun! He's gone!

145
00:11:37,150 --> 00:11:39,600
Gigantrex is gone!

146
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:40,942
Wh- What?!
