1
00:00:01,840 --> 00:00:05,341
Catch Me! Outlaw of the Sea!

2
00:00:43,237 --> 00:00:46,758
Aaah!!

3
00:00:46,758 --> 00:00:48,412
Jun! What's wrong?!

4
00:00:49,515 --> 00:00:50,762
He just has a cavity.

5
00:00:50,762 --> 00:00:52,137
A cavity?

6
00:00:52,137 --> 00:00:56,634
When you eat and don't brush your teeth, cavity bacteria multiply and cause your teeth to rot.

7
00:00:56,634 --> 00:00:57,936
Your teeth can rot?

8
00:00:58,177 --> 00:01:01,942
Hah! Whaddya know, you humans are so fragile!

9
00:01:02,273 --> 00:01:07,251
Our bodies are made of Machinasium and cannot be dissolved by any acidic substances.

10
00:01:09,504 --> 00:01:12,539
But... we don't have teeth in the first place.

11
00:01:12,539 --> 00:01:14,947
Why not just go to the dentist and get it fixed?

12
00:01:14,947 --> 00:01:19,379
Easy for you to say! The dentist is so scary!

13
00:01:19,379 --> 00:01:21,575
Really? I wouldn't know, because I've never been to the dentist.

14
00:01:21,575 --> 00:01:23,322
Peruru, can you say "Ahhh"?

15
00:01:23,322 --> 00:01:25,129
Ahhh...

16
00:01:25,384 --> 00:01:27,311
Ooh! They're so sparkling white!

17
00:01:27,311 --> 00:01:29,799
Jun, you should take notes from her.

18
00:01:31,751 --> 00:01:33,936
Hey, Crest. Huh?

19
00:01:34,225 --> 00:01:35,234
What?

20
00:01:36,356 --> 00:01:39,962
A strange car was found sunken off the cliffside of Mowtown's beach.

21
00:01:43,355 --> 00:01:44,662
Glober?!

22
00:01:44,662 --> 00:01:46,372
Glober? What's wrong with Glober?!

23
00:01:46,372 --> 00:01:48,766
Crest, stay there and keep an eye on him.

24
00:01:48,766 --> 00:01:49,507
I will.

25
00:01:50,379 --> 00:01:51,911
Let's call uncle Edo.

26
00:01:51,911 --> 00:01:54,415
Okay. We should ask him to check on Glober.

27
00:01:57,805 --> 00:01:59,185
Have you come to your senses?

28
00:01:59,185 --> 00:02:01,0
You almost drowned out there.

29
00:02:01,0 --> 00:02:03,289
What happened to you?

30
00:02:06,132 --> 00:02:08,366
Well, it's a long story, but...

31
00:02:08,366 --> 00:02:14,105
Have you guys heard about the recent series of unusual accidents in the waters of Mowtown?

32
00:02:14,105 --> 00:02:15,50
Unusual accidents?

33
00:02:15,50 --> 00:02:16,616
Leisure boats capsized,

34
00:02:16,616 --> 00:02:17,949
fishing boats sunk,

35
00:02:17,949 --> 00:02:20,383
large cruise ships went missing...

36
00:02:20,383 --> 00:02:23,516
All within the last month. 

37
00:02:23,516 --> 00:02:25,983
I went to investigate 'cause it seemed fishy. 

38
00:02:28,205 --> 00:02:30,625
And when I got there, he showed up.

39
00:02:30,625 --> 00:02:34,444
Known and feared by all as the Outlaw of the Sea back on planet Machina...

40
00:02:34,444 --> 00:02:35,450
Deep Bite!

41
00:03:12,492 --> 00:03:14,234
Is he like Jaws or something?

42
00:03:14,234 --> 00:03:18,326
Now that you mention it, didn't you say you saw a Metal Cardbot that looks like a shark, Crest?

43
00:03:18,326 --> 00:03:23,168
Yes. I saw him clearly when we were looking for the fourth Metal Card tablet.

44
00:03:29,216 --> 00:03:34,676
That guy's biting everything in sight. I'd be done for if I didn't have a helmet on.

45
00:03:34,676 --> 00:03:38,276
Wait! This looks just like the wound on Gigantrex's head!

46
00:03:39,197 --> 00:03:41,688
Don't tell me, the reason why the captain was acting strange...

47
00:03:41,688 --> 00:03:44,850
Perhaps it's because he was bitten by Deep Bite and his thinking circuits went haywire?

48
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:46,796
That can of tuna is gonna pay!

49
00:03:46,796 --> 00:03:49,625
We need to seal Deep Bite before he causes any more trouble!

50
00:03:49,625 --> 00:03:52,721
How can we lure him out here when he's in the ocean?

51
00:03:52,721 --> 00:03:55,232
Don't worry! I've got a plan.

52
00:04:01,168 --> 00:04:07,534
A long time ago, the beautiful Princess Andromeda was sacrificed to a sea monster for the good of the kingdom. 

53
00:04:07,534 --> 00:04:12,419
But! The hero Perseus bravely defeated the monster and rescued her. 

54
00:04:12,419 --> 00:04:19,643
The king was so pleased that he rewarded Perseus with a great riches, and the people remembered his heroism for a long, long time. 

55
00:04:19,643 --> 00:04:20,667
Which inspired me...

56
00:04:20,667 --> 00:04:23,797
To lure the sea monster out with beautiful bait! "Operation Andromeda!"

57
00:04:23,797 --> 00:04:25,230
NO!

58
00:04:25,473 --> 00:04:27,105
Eh? Why not?

59
00:04:27,105 --> 00:04:30,257
Why? Why should we be shark food?!

60
00:04:30,257 --> 00:04:32,194
But you and Crest are...

61
00:04:32,194 --> 00:04:34,929
GAAH!! I'm not doing this!!

62
00:04:34,929 --> 00:04:39,316
Why would a Metal Cardbot chase after pretty people in the first place?

63
00:04:39,316 --> 00:04:42,632
Jun, you're only doing this because you want to be the hero, aren't you?

64
00:04:42,632 --> 00:04:43,665
Thank you, Jun!

65
00:04:43,665 --> 00:04:45,139
You're the best!

66
00:04:45,139 --> 00:04:46,605
Is that it, Jun?

67
00:04:46,605 --> 00:04:50,725
Wha- No! I'm being framed! Let's move on to the next plan!

68
00:04:50,725 --> 00:04:53,497
First, you all dive into the ocean.

69
00:04:54,598 --> 00:04:57,355
Then you're going to make a lot of noise together. 

70
00:04:57,355 --> 00:05:01,473
This will drive Deep Bite into shallow water.

71
00:05:01,473 --> 00:05:03,547
Then, pow! You all swoop in and defeat him!

72
00:05:03,547 --> 00:05:04,999
Do we really have to do this?

73
00:05:04,999 --> 00:05:05,666
Of course!

74
00:05:05,666 --> 00:05:08,276
But if we get soaked with salt water, our bodies will rust!

75
00:05:08,276 --> 00:05:11,868
Ehhh?? Whaddya know, you Metal Cardbots are so fragile!

76
00:05:12,769 --> 00:05:14,750
I can't swim.

77
00:05:15,125 --> 00:05:18,761
You don't need to worry about that. All you have to do is walk along the sea floor.

78
00:05:19,334 --> 00:05:22,278
But this plan has one fatal flaw.

79
00:05:22,278 --> 00:05:23,331
A flaw?

80
00:05:23,331 --> 00:05:24,651
Yeah. A flaw.~

81
00:05:25,315 --> 00:05:26,533
What are you doing?

82
00:05:26,533 --> 00:05:28,673
Can you speak normally, please...?

83
00:05:28,673 --> 00:05:33,852
Didn't you hear me earlier? Deep Bite is chomping down on everything in sight. 

84
00:05:33,852 --> 00:05:36,231
If you get caught in his path, you'll end up like this...

85
00:05:36,632 --> 00:05:38,143
One by one.

86
00:05:38,939 --> 00:05:40,696
NOOO!!

87
00:05:41,502 --> 00:05:43,959
Can't we use your submarine?

88
00:05:43,959 --> 00:05:46,915
Deep Bite is faster than that. We'll get chewed up right away.

89
00:05:46,915 --> 00:05:49,985
How about floating a propane tank in the water and using it as a bomb?

90
00:05:49,985 --> 00:05:52,180
You wanna blow him up or something?!

91
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:55,225
We're not trying to kill any sharks.

92
00:05:55,225 --> 00:05:59,411
I asked my dad to make this area off-limits to ships for the time being.

93
00:05:59,411 --> 00:06:01,692
Good job, Anna! You're always one step ahead.

94
00:06:01,692 --> 00:06:07,478
That's all you got? Think more! This has been going on for hours!

95
00:06:07,478 --> 00:06:08,564
What are you doing over here?

96
00:06:09,583 --> 00:06:12,714
We should be thinking up a way to catch Deep Bite together.

97
00:06:13,735 --> 00:06:15,242
Well, about that...

98
00:06:16,745 --> 00:06:19,692
What? Friends?! You're friends with that Outlaw of the Sea?!

99
00:06:19,692 --> 00:06:25,298
Shhh! He was rough around the edges, sure. But he wasn't the kind of guy who would just bite people for no reason. 

100
00:06:25,298 --> 00:06:29,103
I don't know what's made him so violent...

101
00:06:30,603 --> 00:06:32,297
Alright! The new plan is done!

102
00:06:32,297 --> 00:06:36,612
First, we'll use Musclehyde's Crane Bhuh as a fishing rod. 

103
00:06:36,612 --> 00:06:42,869
Hook the bait, and cast it out to sea. When Deep Bite takes the bait, we'll reel him in! 

104
00:06:45,331 --> 00:06:48,251
I call it Operation: Hook, Line, and Sinker!

105
00:06:49,351 --> 00:06:51,790
Musclehyde! Set up!

106
00:07:10,290 --> 00:07:11,153
What?

107
00:07:11,857 --> 00:07:14,485
W-wait, when you said bait, you didn't mean-

108
00:07:14,485 --> 00:07:16,322
Let's do this, Musclehyde!

109
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:22,372
WHY MEEEEE?!

110
00:07:29,471 --> 00:07:32,79
The trick to bait fishing is to push and pull.

111
00:07:32,79 --> 00:07:36,687
It's all about bobbing your bait so that it looks tasty enough to entice the fish.

112
00:07:36,687 --> 00:07:38,247
Ah, like this?

113
00:07:49,356 --> 00:07:50,345
I got a bite!

114
00:07:50,345 --> 00:07:51,789
Great! Reel him in!

115
00:07:53,216 --> 00:07:54,913
I can't! He's too heavy!

116
00:07:54,913 --> 00:07:56,606
Then let us work together!

117
00:07:56,606 --> 00:07:59,711
Heave-ho! Heave-ho!

118
00:08:03,293 --> 00:08:04,558
The wire snapped!

119
00:08:04,675 --> 00:08:06,750
Th-then what about Red Blitz?!

120
00:08:08,574 --> 00:08:11,927
Red Blitz, we'll never forget you...

121
00:08:12,928 --> 00:08:14,978
You can't get rid of me that easily!

122
00:08:14,978 --> 00:08:16,49
You little scamp!

123
00:08:16,49 --> 00:08:17,250
You're okay!

124
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:21,423
"Okay" my butt! I thought I was gonna die when he bit me!

125
00:08:21,882 --> 00:08:23,159
That's...

126
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:29,353
A shark tooth.

127
00:08:30,797 --> 00:08:33,336
Alright, let's try the Hook, Line, and Sinker one more ti-

128
00:08:34,149 --> 00:08:36,278
Here's an idea. Why don't you go this time?

129
00:08:38,395 --> 00:08:39,235
Jun!

130
00:08:48,585 --> 00:08:49,585
JUN!!

131
00:08:49,585 --> 00:08:50,859
Musclehyde!

132
00:09:10,139 --> 00:09:12,699
JUN!! Let me go!

133
00:09:12,699 --> 00:09:14,687
But you can't swim either!

134
00:09:14,687 --> 00:09:16,620
I said I'm sorry...

135
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:18,225
JUUUUUUN!!!

136
00:09:28,317 --> 00:09:30,989
That oversized guppy! Hey, you!

137
00:09:30,989 --> 00:09:32,395
Wait, Red Blitz!

138
00:09:34,624 --> 00:09:36,144
Now let go of Jun.

139
00:09:39,745 --> 00:09:40,823
Jun!!

140
00:09:43,669 --> 00:09:44,888
Where am I?

141
00:09:44,888 --> 00:09:46,149
Thank goodness you're okay!

142
00:09:46,649 --> 00:09:48,911
Deep Bite? Can you recognize me?

143
00:09:49,711 --> 00:09:52,500
Glober! You were on this planet too?

144
00:09:54,158 --> 00:09:56,963
Well now, quite the gentleman for a sea outlaw.

145
00:09:56,963 --> 00:09:58,544
It's all because of this.

146
00:09:58,544 --> 00:10:00,317
This tooth?

147
00:10:00,317 --> 00:10:02,613
He had the same problem as someone else here.

148
00:10:02,613 --> 00:10:05,509
Deep Bite must've been suffering from tooth decay, too.

149
00:10:06,551 --> 00:10:09,426
Thinking about tooth decay makes it hurt even more...

150
00:10:09,426 --> 00:10:10,663
Want me to pull it out?

151
00:10:10,663 --> 00:10:12,934
Aah! N-n-n-no thanks!

152
00:10:24,139 --> 00:10:25,508
It's done!

153
00:10:28,452 --> 00:10:31,700
It feels like I'm born anew. Thank you so much.

154
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:33,100
You're very much welcome!

155
00:10:33,493 --> 00:10:36,111
I want to return the favor. You can ask anything of me.

156
00:10:36,111 --> 00:10:36,899
Anything? 

157
00:10:36,899 --> 00:10:39,720
Yeah. I'll do whatever I can for you.

158
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:42,203
Then... how about joining us?

159
00:10:42,203 --> 00:10:42,991
Sure.

160
00:10:42,991 --> 00:10:43,788
Huh?

161
00:10:43,788 --> 00:10:45,644
Deep Bite, are you sure about this?

162
00:10:45,644 --> 00:10:47,605
I won't go back on my word.

163
00:10:47,605 --> 00:10:48,626
You did it!

164
00:10:48,626 --> 00:10:49,988
Good for you, Jun!

165
00:10:50,249 --> 00:10:51,149
Alrighty!

166
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:54,338
Metal Cardbot! Change Up!

167
00:10:54,338 --> 00:10:55,620
WAIIIIT!! (FX-changeFail)

168
00:10:55,918 --> 00:10:57,379
Red Blitz?

169
00:10:59,953 --> 00:11:02,690
I'm not gonna accept him as our ally!

170
00:11:02,956 --> 00:11:04,554
Red Blitz...
