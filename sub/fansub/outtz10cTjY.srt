1
00:00:01,806 --> 00:00:05,213
Cielo is Upset!

2
00:00:08,445 --> 00:00:10,710
Wow, a fighter jet!

3
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:12,275
Oh, is this our new companion?

4
00:00:12,791 --> 00:00:14,198
This is Cielo.

5
00:00:14,198 --> 00:00:16,111
Cielo, I'm Theo.

6
00:00:16,111 --> 00:00:18,135
And I'm Anna. Nice to meet you!

7
00:00:19,562 --> 00:00:23,530
This one hasn't answered anything we've been trying to ask all day.

8
00:00:23,530 --> 00:00:25,609
Your colleague, Red Blitz. Do you know where we could find him?

9
00:00:25,609 --> 00:00:26,940
I don't know.

10
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:29,564
Red Blitz knew where to find you. 

11
00:00:30,896 --> 00:00:34,636
So I'm sure you know where we could find Musclehyde and Gigantrex as well.

12
00:00:34,636 --> 00:00:37,563
You're stubborn. I said I don't know.

13
00:00:37,563 --> 00:00:42,487
Red Blitz stole my Metal Breath. Please tell me what you know!

14
00:00:42,487 --> 00:00:48,820
I really don't know! You think I know the answer to that when I don't even know where I am?!

15
00:00:50,442 --> 00:00:53,375
You kiiiids!! 

16
00:00:53,375 --> 00:00:58,609
I said my garage is only for automobiles! Stop bringing airplanes in here!

17
00:00:58,609 --> 00:00:59,826
Please calm down!

18
00:01:00,176 --> 00:01:03,320
Well, we kind of have a reason...

19
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:04,989
What reason?!
Here! 

20
00:01:04,989 --> 00:01:09,212
There's a hole where they were stabbed with her spear. I thought you could fix it.

21
00:01:09,212 --> 00:01:10,289
Huh? Why me?

22
00:01:10,289 --> 00:01:12,670
'Cause uncle Edo is a master of repair!

23
00:01:12,670 --> 00:01:15,545
And you'll fix this in a blink of an eye!

24
00:01:15,545 --> 00:01:17,902
Now come on, chop chop!

25
00:01:20,435 --> 00:01:25,888
Hmm. Maybe I can fix this with something like polycarbonate...

26
00:01:25,888 --> 00:01:28,349
Oh, what a relief!
I'm counting on you, uncle Edo!

27
00:01:28,349 --> 00:01:30,188
Please take good care of them!

28
00:01:30,188 --> 00:01:32,572
Huh? Wha- guys! Wait!

29
00:01:32,572 --> 00:01:36,655
Geez... Just what do those kids think of me?

30
00:01:38,694 --> 00:01:42,581
It's raining like crazy. Even my socks are soaked through.

31
00:01:42,581 --> 00:01:46,472
It seems the weather will be gloomy until tomorrow. There's a heavy storm warning too.

32
00:01:46,472 --> 00:01:55,496
At least Cielo won't be the only gloomy one around here. Let's come up with a plan, Peruru. How can we find a way to get Cielo to open up-

33
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:01,287
Wha- What the- heck is this!?

34
00:02:01,287 --> 00:02:02,796
Oh, you're finally here!

35
00:02:02,796 --> 00:02:04,358
H-hello.

36
00:02:04,358 --> 00:02:07,146
Mom! What is all this...?

37
00:02:07,146 --> 00:02:09,234
Here. My gift for Peruru!

38
00:02:09,234 --> 00:02:11,230
Uh, thank you.

39
00:02:11,230 --> 00:02:16,610
Mom! What have you done?! What did you do to my room?!

40
00:02:16,610 --> 00:02:17,997
It's not your room anymore.

41
00:02:17,997 --> 00:02:18,438
What?!

42
00:02:18,438 --> 00:02:20,181
It's Peruru's room from now on.

43
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:26,840
I was only going to change the bedsheets, but for some reason I just couldn't stop making changes here and there. 

44
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:28,828
I've always wanted a daughter, to be honest!

45
00:02:28,828 --> 00:02:30,770
I-I'm happy too.

46
00:02:30,770 --> 00:02:32,586
Really? I'm glad!

47
00:02:32,586 --> 00:02:35,108
That's why I'd like to repay the favor!

48
00:02:35,108 --> 00:02:36,370
Repay me?

49
00:02:41,867 --> 00:02:42,668
It's done!

50
00:02:42,668 --> 00:02:46,521
Oh my! Peruru has such lovely craftsmanship!

51
00:02:46,622 --> 00:02:48,524
It's a symbol that's been passed down in my village.

52
00:02:48,524 --> 00:02:55,146
Oh, I love it! Now we have matching friendship handkerchiefs! Aren't you just the cutest thing?

53
00:02:55,146 --> 00:02:58,485
Mom, please don't forget about your son...

54
00:03:06,227 --> 00:03:08,615
She's gonna' pay for this...

55
00:03:08,615 --> 00:03:09,935
Jun, are you okay?

56
00:03:09,935 --> 00:03:14,423
There's nothing I can do about my room, but how long am I expected to sleep out here?

57
00:03:14,423 --> 00:03:16,210
What about sleeping in the living room?

58
00:03:16,453 --> 00:03:20,955
No way! It can't be helped, I guess...

59
00:03:20,955 --> 00:03:27,521
Do you think Cielo will be okay? Won't they be scared being alone in the garage during a storm like this?

60
00:03:27,521 --> 00:03:30,783
Eh, Cielo being scared? There's no way.

61
00:03:30,783 --> 00:03:34,257
I was scared. Until I met you.

62
00:03:34,257 --> 00:03:35,740
Bluecop...

63
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:38,848
I think Cielo needs a friend.

64
00:03:38,848 --> 00:03:44,831
Alright. I'll do whatever it takes. I want to be their friend, after all!

65
00:03:44,831 --> 00:03:46,211
Thank you, Jun.

66
00:03:59,918 --> 00:04:01,711
What are you doing?

67
00:04:01,711 --> 00:04:06,216
What does it look like? Don't you feel your body moving to the beat of this music?

68
00:04:06,216 --> 00:04:06,895
Huh?

69
00:04:07,574 --> 00:04:10,676
My fried Mega Trucker really loved dancing.

70
00:04:13,387 --> 00:04:14,538
Clear the area!

71
00:04:20,978 --> 00:04:22,120
So? Won't you join us?

72
00:04:31,269 --> 00:04:33,211
You two! What do you think you're doing?

73
00:04:33,211 --> 00:04:34,913
I- I'm sorry!!

74
00:04:37,812 --> 00:04:40,795
Hey, Cielo. Let's play soccer!

75
00:04:40,795 --> 00:04:42,350
What's that?

76
00:04:42,350 --> 00:04:44,449
It's a game where you kick the ball into your opponent's goal.

77
00:04:44,449 --> 00:04:47,557
Shadow X was the best at soccer.

78
00:04:52,268 --> 00:04:55,634
Way to go! Alright!

79
00:04:55,634 --> 00:04:56,814
It's on!

80
00:05:02,524 --> 00:05:07,875
Then how about a game of chess? Our genius inventor Buster Gallon was great at it.

81
00:05:07,875 --> 00:05:10,600
Yes, there. Checkmate!

82
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:11,942
Waaagh! That's the 19th loss!

83
00:05:11,942 --> 00:05:13,218
Maybe I should go easy on you.

84
00:05:13,218 --> 00:05:16,600
... Of course, I always won.

85
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:17,689
I doubt it.

86
00:05:17,369 --> 00:05:22,733
Then how about a sword fight? Wild Guardy trained me, so I'm really strong!

87
00:05:22,932 --> 00:05:24,314
I'm a gunslinger.

88
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:30,250
Feeling Hungry? Buffalo Crush liked eating from my garden generator.

89
00:05:30,884 --> 00:05:32,129
I lost my appetite.

90
00:05:32,129 --> 00:05:38,449
Wanna play the flute, then? Flute playing was Fleta Z's specialty. Listen to this!

91
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:43,172
That sounds terrible. Just leave me alone!

92
00:05:43,271 --> 00:05:49,172
Just give it a chance! How about this? No? Then how about this?

93
00:05:49,172 --> 00:05:50,432
It's hopeless.

94
00:05:52,487 --> 00:05:55,401
It's come down to this... Time for my last resort!

95
00:05:59,139 --> 00:06:00,987
There. All done!

96
00:06:08,413 --> 00:06:09,487
Now what?

97
00:06:09,487 --> 00:06:15,278
Just once, I've always wanted to fly. I dare say, it's like a dangerous challenge to the sky. 

98
00:06:15,278 --> 00:06:17,338
What do you say, Cielo?

99
00:06:17,338 --> 00:06:18,454
Just don't throw up.

100
00:06:41,891 --> 00:06:44,432
Feel like your stomache's upside down yet?

101
00:06:44,432 --> 00:06:46,805
I can take it!

102
00:06:46,805 --> 00:06:49,840
That so? Then how about this?!

103
00:06:59,182 --> 00:07:01,656
What's the matter? Giving up already?

104
00:07:01,656 --> 00:07:04,959
No! I won't give up until- 

105
00:07:06,177 --> 00:07:07,805
Until I make friends with you!

106
00:07:07,805 --> 00:07:08,709
Shut it!

107
00:07:18,768 --> 00:07:21,266
Jun! A-Are you okay?!

108
00:07:21,266 --> 00:07:25,730
Look at you, defeated so easily. Don't ever say you want to fly again.

109
00:07:25,730 --> 00:07:27,225
Yes, I will...

110
00:07:27,225 --> 00:07:30,899
Still haven't come to your senses yet? You just don't get it!

111
00:07:32,514 --> 00:07:34,300
Cielo! Let go of Jun!

112
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:36,605
I'm okay.
But...

113
00:07:36,605 --> 00:07:38,691
I trust Cielo.

114
00:07:44,762 --> 00:07:47,305
Huh? Wait a minute, you..

115
00:07:47,305 --> 00:07:48,254
What now?

116
00:07:48,254 --> 00:07:51,125
Can I see that mark on your head?

117
00:07:52,757 --> 00:07:54,180
This symbol...

118
00:07:58,699 --> 00:08:01,221
It looks like the same symbol that's been passed down in my village!

119
00:08:02,110 --> 00:08:04,439
But yours has become faded.

120
00:08:04,439 --> 00:08:04,894
What?!

121
00:08:07,644 --> 00:08:09,788
No way! My symbol of friendship with Mukara!

122
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:11,975
Symbol of friendship?

123
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:21,980
The friendship between us humans and the giants from the sea of stars, will be forevermore. Now, I shall inscribe that oath here.

124
00:08:23,269 --> 00:08:30,269
It's only been 4,000 years since that day. And yet our symbol of friendship was erased in vain like this, in such little time.

125
00:08:30,269 --> 00:08:36,235
It's not like that. That friendship remains in your heart, even if the symbol is gone.

126
00:08:36,235 --> 00:08:37,528
But...

127
00:08:45,450 --> 00:08:46,206
This is bad!

128
00:08:46,649 --> 00:08:51,538
-Firefighters are still struggling to contain the wildfires in the northeast of Mowtown. 

129
00:08:51,538 --> 00:08:53,739
-While the danger of wildfires spreading to residential areas is raising public concern, 

130
00:08:53,739 --> 00:08:54,730
-While the danger of wildfires spreading to residential areas is raising public concern,
-It's worse than I thought.

131
00:08:54,730 --> 00:08:56,822
-While the danger of wildfires spreading to residential areas is raising public concern,
-If only Phoenix Fire was here...

132
00:08:56,822 --> 00:08:59,110
-Fire authorities are mobilizing all personnel to...

133
00:08:59,110 --> 00:09:01,288
Cielo! I have a favor to ask!

134
00:09:01,288 --> 00:09:01,965
A favor?

135
00:09:01,965 --> 00:09:04,421
Fly with me one more time!

136
00:09:10,130 --> 00:09:14,740
Cielo, let's fly right over that flame.

137
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:16,432
I don't know what that will accomplish, but alright.

138
00:09:16,432 --> 00:09:17,499
Thanks!

139
00:09:27,587 --> 00:09:29,101
I think that just barely worked.

140
00:09:29,101 --> 00:09:30,182
Was that the best you can do?

141
00:09:30,182 --> 00:09:30,955
What?

142
00:09:30,955 --> 00:09:33,706
Fly through it as fast as you can!

143
00:09:33,706 --> 00:09:35,918
Your body won't be able to handle my speed.

144
00:09:35,918 --> 00:09:39,149
We got some practice in earlier, I'll be fine!

145
00:09:39,149 --> 00:09:41,221
Alright then. Hang on tight!

146
00:10:04,229 --> 00:10:10,225
Surpassing the speed of sound created a vacuum that cut off oxygen to the flames! Not a bad plan.

147
00:10:10,225 --> 00:10:13,389
Yea, exactly. Hehehe...

148
00:10:13,389 --> 00:10:14,437
Good thinking, Jun.

149
00:10:15,235 --> 00:10:16,965
Oh, you started calling me by my name.

150
00:10:16,965 --> 00:10:18,481
You- You Misheard me!

151
00:10:18,481 --> 00:10:20,673
I heard right!

152
00:10:20,673 --> 00:10:22,470
Forget it. Let's just put this fire out!

153
00:10:22,470 --> 00:10:24,947
Aaagh!! Not so fast!

154
00:10:25,235 --> 00:10:28,235
-Thankfully, the wildfire was quickly brought under control.

155
00:10:28,235 --> 00:10:32,418
-The miraculous speed at which authorities were able to work in such bad weather conditions...

156
00:10:32,418 --> 00:10:33,619
It's done.

157
00:10:34,619 --> 00:10:35,682
Look there.

158
00:10:38,873 --> 00:10:40,711
It's perfect.
There.

159
00:10:42,837 --> 00:10:45,851
Now you and I are friends, right?

160
00:10:48,427 --> 00:10:51,690
Yeah, friends.

161
00:10:51,952 --> 00:10:56,389
Cielo, I'd like to ask about the Metal Breath Red Blitz took from us.

162
00:10:56,389 --> 00:11:01,990
Don't worry. I'll ask him to bring it back next time I see him. 

163
00:11:01,990 --> 00:11:04,764
But don't get your hopes up. He's hotheaded.

164
00:11:04,764 --> 00:11:05,927
Thank you, Cielo.

165
00:11:07,432 --> 00:11:09,873
Wow! the sky is clear now!

166
00:11:09,873 --> 00:11:14,716
Hang in there a little longer, my friends. I'll definitely save you.
