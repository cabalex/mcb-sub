1
00:00:01,855 --> 00:00:05,211
Help Me, Deep Bite!

2
00:00:06,434 --> 00:00:09,62
I'm not gonna accept him as our ally!

3
00:00:09,961 --> 00:00:11,104
Red Blitz...

4
00:00:11,704 --> 00:00:15,507
Oi, fish! I don't like you.

5
00:00:15,507 --> 00:00:17,547
What are you doing, Red Blitz?

6
00:00:17,547 --> 00:00:19,579
What has Deep Bite ever done to you?

7
00:00:19,979 --> 00:00:22,730
Do you really have to ask?! Look at this!

8
00:00:23,913 --> 00:00:26,344
It was a mistake to use Red Blitz as bait...

9
00:00:26,344 --> 00:00:31,184
At the least- no, the leastest, I can forgive him for this wound.

10
00:00:31,184 --> 00:00:34,801
But! I can't forgive him for biting my dad's head!

11
00:00:34,801 --> 00:00:36,649
Dad? What are you talking about?

12
00:00:36,649 --> 00:00:38,173
Don't you dare play dumb!

13
00:00:38,173 --> 00:00:42,345
I'm sorry... I had a bad tooth ache at the time, so my memory's a bit hazy.

14
00:00:42,765 --> 00:00:47,445
Then maybe you'll remember if I knock the screws out of you! Come outside!

15
00:00:47,445 --> 00:00:50,387
Cut it out, Red Blitz. You're making Deep Bite uncomforta-

16
00:00:50,387 --> 00:00:51,548
Great idea!

17
00:00:54,868 --> 00:00:57,810
I was starting to get fed up with your attitude!

18
00:00:57,810 --> 00:01:00,113
- Oh no!
- He was such a gentleman before!

19
00:01:00,113 --> 00:01:02,79
That explains why he was called an outlaw.

20
00:01:02,79 --> 00:01:03,189
Shouldn't we stop them?

21
00:01:03,189 --> 00:01:04,701
Stop it, you two! Don't fight!

22
00:01:04,701 --> 00:01:06,888
Lemme go home already!

23
00:01:10,469 --> 00:01:12,850
It's... not much of a fight.

24
00:01:14,150 --> 00:01:16,357
Red Blitz is getting owned...

25
00:01:24,962 --> 00:01:27,774
What's the matter? Is it your bedtime already, baby boy?

26
00:01:28,942 --> 00:01:31,501
I'm gonna make you pay, fish!

27
00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:35,269
The power gap between the two is overwhelming.

28
00:01:35,368 --> 00:01:36,633
Poor Red Blitz...

29
00:01:37,489 --> 00:01:39,400
Metal Breath! Pick up!

30
00:01:42,664 --> 00:01:44,615
Red Blitz! Set up!

31
00:01:57,212 --> 00:02:00,292
Now we're talkin'! I'm gonna make grilled fish outta you!

32
00:02:00,292 --> 00:02:01,605
What are you doing, Jun?!

33
00:02:01,605 --> 00:02:04,362
I can't just stand by and watch Red Blitz get owned!

34
00:02:04,362 --> 00:02:06,446
Heheh! Bring it on!

35
00:02:11,705 --> 00:02:12,960
You're letting this fight get out of hand!

36
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:14,930
How are you planning to sort this out?

37
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:16,466
Let's do this, Jun! 

38
00:02:16,466 --> 00:02:18,271
Yeah! Crimson Shoot!

39
00:02:18,271 --> 00:02:19,366
Jun!!!

40
00:02:19,366 --> 00:02:21,718
Crimson Shoot!

41
00:02:21,718 --> 00:02:24,151
Beam Trident!!

42
00:02:34,915 --> 00:02:35,745
Nice job!

43
00:02:35,745 --> 00:02:36,723
There's nothing nice about this!!

44
00:02:36,723 --> 00:02:37,975
Let's go, Red Blitz!

45
00:02:37,975 --> 00:02:38,939
Cielo!

46
00:02:38,939 --> 00:02:40,689
Surely this is for the best!

47
00:02:40,689 --> 00:02:41,465
Huh?

48
00:02:41,465 --> 00:02:45,687
They'll understand each other faster by talking with their fists!

49
00:02:48,801 --> 00:02:50,651
You fought well back there!

50
00:02:50,651 --> 00:02:52,543
Heh. Not so bad yourself!

51
00:02:55,586 --> 00:02:57,343
I see, it must be an Earth custom!

52
00:02:57,343 --> 00:02:59,800
I'd love to cover this in detail! Can you explain, please?

53
00:03:00,268 --> 00:03:01,848
Is that how it goes in Mowtown?

54
00:03:01,848 --> 00:03:03,114
Of course not...

55
00:03:05,399 --> 00:03:09,77
I'm not afraid of any fish out of water!

56
00:03:09,77 --> 00:03:11,156
Jun! Let's finish this already!

57
00:03:11,978 --> 00:03:15,776
Sorry about this, Deep Bite. But... Scarlet Hurricane!

58
00:03:15,776 --> 00:03:17,100
I don't want any part of this...

59
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:18,502
Scarlet...

60
00:03:18,502 --> 00:03:22,414
Heh! You think I can only swim in the ocean?!

61
00:03:24,848 --> 00:03:27,277
Hurricane!!

62
00:03:27,377 --> 00:03:30,183
Trident! Submarine!!

63
00:03:38,219 --> 00:03:38,848
Mist?

64
00:03:38,848 --> 00:03:40,343
I can't see anything!

65
00:03:40,543 --> 00:03:42,651
W-What the heck is this?

66
00:03:44,889 --> 00:03:46,485
Show yourself already!

67
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:51,185
There!

68
00:03:56,860 --> 00:03:57,997
Red Blitz?

69
00:03:59,647 --> 00:04:00,872
Red Blitz!

70
00:04:03,701 --> 00:04:05,634
This is getting serious...!

71
00:04:05,634 --> 00:04:07,473
What have you done?!

72
00:04:07,473 --> 00:04:09,850
This is too much, even for what he did!

73
00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:13,271
Be thankful I didn't swallow him whole!

74
00:04:14,323 --> 00:04:17,153
- What?! Hey!
- Rein it in, rein it in!

75
00:04:17,153 --> 00:04:21,997
- Come here! I said, come here!!
- Deep Bite, the outlaw of the sea... it'll be hard to get along with him.

76
00:04:21,997 --> 00:04:24,831
Jun! I'm not gonna fight alongside that guy!

77
00:04:24,831 --> 00:04:27,516
Heh! Took the words right out of my mouth!

78
00:04:27,995 --> 00:04:31,129
Instead of understanding each other, the fight only escalated...

79
00:04:31,129 --> 00:04:32,898
How are you going to fix this?

80
00:04:33,749 --> 00:04:35,577
I can't leave things like this.

81
00:04:35,577 --> 00:04:37,452
I-I'll go with you!

82
00:04:37,452 --> 00:04:40,350
We'll bring Deep Bite back! You guys take care of Red Blitz!

83
00:04:40,963 --> 00:04:43,538
Uuwoooogh... My butt...

84
00:04:48,744 --> 00:04:51,704
Anyone here...?

85
00:04:52,911 --> 00:04:54,615
WAAAAAHHHHH!!

86
00:04:54,615 --> 00:04:57,252
Relax, Jun. It's just Deep Bite.

87
00:04:58,191 --> 00:04:59,572
Ah, sorry...

88
00:04:59,572 --> 00:05:02,555
Don't bother. I'm used to that kind of reaction.

89
00:05:02,555 --> 00:05:04,302
I thought so.

90
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:08,214
I don't think you're an outlaw or someone dangerous.

91
00:05:08,214 --> 00:05:10,461
Me neither. You don't seem dangerous.

92
00:05:10,461 --> 00:05:12,307
And that's coming from my intuition as a Star Guardian.

93
00:05:12,307 --> 00:05:13,973
Ugh. It's all because of my face.

94
00:05:13,973 --> 00:05:14,916
Huh?

95
00:05:14,916 --> 00:05:20,684
This scary looking face. It's the reason why everyone is afraid of me. 

96
00:05:20,684 --> 00:05:23,803
So then I thought, "I'll become someone who's truly terrifying!"

97
00:05:23,803 --> 00:05:26,514
That's how I became an outlaw.

98
00:05:26,514 --> 00:05:27,925
Isn't it pitiful?

99
00:05:27,925 --> 00:05:29,516
Deep Bite...

100
00:05:29,516 --> 00:05:30,995
Terrifying?

101
00:05:31,778 --> 00:05:32,533
You?

102
00:05:32,533 --> 00:05:36,975
W-what? Look at my face! Don't you think it's scary?

103
00:05:36,975 --> 00:05:38,473
You're not scary at all!

104
00:05:38,473 --> 00:05:43,569
Of course, it was a bit scary when you guys started to fight, but that's Red Blitz's fault, so...

105
00:05:43,569 --> 00:05:45,725
Wait! Look closer!

106
00:05:45,725 --> 00:05:49,483
Look how big my mouth is, and how sharp my teeth are! Look!

107
00:05:49,483 --> 00:05:52,689
You can say that, but I can't really see it.

108
00:05:52,689 --> 00:05:54,747
You know the moles that live on this planet, right?

109
00:05:54,747 --> 00:05:59,605
I'm like a mole. I only know where you are by using infrared and sound.

110
00:05:59,605 --> 00:06:00,987
I didn't know that...

111
00:06:02,557 --> 00:06:05,653
Hehahaha! Alright!

112
00:06:06,305 --> 00:06:10,619
So you're really not scared of me? I've never heard those words until now!

113
00:06:12,312 --> 00:06:15,920
I almost can't believe scaredy pants Rock Crush isn't scared of him at all.

114
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:19,798
Hey, why are you guys all laughing? All I said was that I'm not scared of him.

115
00:06:20,288 --> 00:06:24,425
It would be nice if Red Blitz and the others could understand that you're not someone to fear.

116
00:06:25,225 --> 00:06:27,550
Ah! Then how about this?

117
00:06:29,139 --> 00:06:33,326
Remember to follow the script, guys. I'll be the director and the producer!

118
00:06:33,326 --> 00:06:35,979
But I've never tried acting before in my life...

119
00:06:35,979 --> 00:06:38,29
Just believe in me, the director!

120
00:06:38,29 --> 00:06:40,737
Make sure to have your lines memorized by tomorrow!

121
00:06:40,737 --> 00:06:42,574
Will this actually work...?

122
00:06:47,536 --> 00:06:48,649
You're all done.

123
00:06:48,649 --> 00:06:51,398
Ow! I told you to be gentle! 

124
00:06:52,194 --> 00:06:56,29
It's still tingling... I'll make him pay the next time I see him!

125
00:06:56,29 --> 00:06:57,112
Count me in!

126
00:06:57,112 --> 00:06:59,314
Let's go and knock the screws out of him right now!

127
00:06:59,314 --> 00:07:00,540
Let's go!

128
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:01,512
Stop!

129
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:03,872
We're busy, Peruru!

130
00:07:03,872 --> 00:07:08,745
Wouldn't it be better to make peace with Deep Bite, who can dive into the ocean and find the Speranza?

131
00:07:08,745 --> 00:07:10,132
That is true...

132
00:07:10,132 --> 00:07:11,463
She has a point...

133
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:16,619
But he bit the Captain's head! I can't forgive him for that!

134
00:07:16,619 --> 00:07:18,718
Cool your temper and use your head! 

135
00:07:18,718 --> 00:07:22,374
I understand how much you cherish Gigantrex. But!

136
00:07:22,374 --> 00:07:26,230
Think about how Deep Bite felt when you suddenly told him you don't like him.

137
00:07:26,230 --> 00:07:27,805
I'm sure it was startling.

138
00:07:27,805 --> 00:07:29,499
If I were him, I would be angry too!

139
00:07:30,738 --> 00:07:35,384
WE'RE IN TROUBLE! BIIIIIIIG TROUBLE!!

140
00:07:42,966 --> 00:07:45,533
Hey, hey, hey! What is he doing?!

141
00:07:45,533 --> 00:07:48,204
He suddenly went berserk!!

142
00:07:48,204 --> 00:07:53,178
I'm a big bad mole monster- I mean, a big bad Metal Cardbot!

143
00:07:54,413 --> 00:07:55,808
The heck is all this?

144
00:07:56,588 --> 00:07:59,163
Please stop! Rock Crush!!

145
00:08:02,463 --> 00:08:03,834
Wha- You!

146
00:08:06,187 --> 00:08:11,959
Not today, you evil Metal Cardbot! Deep Bite will not forget- 

147
00:08:11,959 --> 00:08:16,339
No, forego- Uh, foreign...

148
00:08:16,339 --> 00:08:20,278
Ugh. I don't know what you're trying to do, but make them stop, Jun. It's dangerous.

149
00:08:20,577 --> 00:08:22,372
M-me? I'm not doing anything!

150
00:08:22,771 --> 00:08:25,581
I'll crush everything in my sight!

151
00:08:40,932 --> 00:08:43,798
My used crane I haven't paid off yet!

152
00:08:45,514 --> 00:08:47,187
Phew. It's sturdy enough...

153
00:08:56,195 --> 00:08:57,144
Get back!

154
00:08:59,331 --> 00:09:02,450
Waahhh!! A monster!!

155
00:09:03,461 --> 00:09:04,969
Rock Crush is in danger!

156
00:09:08,615 --> 00:09:10,158
Rock Crush! I'm he-

157
00:09:17,572 --> 00:09:18,672
Musclehyde!

158
00:09:23,663 --> 00:09:25,289
What is this?!

159
00:09:28,561 --> 00:09:29,403
Cielo!

160
00:09:33,344 --> 00:09:34,466
Go help them!

161
00:09:37,115 --> 00:09:38,645
We'll continue fighting later!

162
00:09:38,645 --> 00:09:39,884
Sounds good to me!

163
00:09:40,311 --> 00:09:41,350
Let's do this!

164
00:09:52,807 --> 00:09:56,200
Guys! Wake up!

165
00:09:58,939 --> 00:10:01,894
Deep Bite! Thanks for helping us out.

166
00:10:01,894 --> 00:10:03,519
It was nothing.

167
00:10:04,826 --> 00:10:07,486
Tch. All that fuss over nothing.

168
00:10:08,514 --> 00:10:10,532
Mission failed, I guess...

169
00:10:11,485 --> 00:10:14,939
Good grief, just do it already!

170
00:10:14,939 --> 00:10:19,414
You wanted to seal him. Do it before I change my mind!

171
00:10:20,490 --> 00:10:20,989
That means-

172
00:10:20,989 --> 00:10:25,350
Make no mistake! I just need him for his diving capabilities.

173
00:10:25,350 --> 00:10:27,244
You just can't be honest, can you?

174
00:10:29,482 --> 00:10:31,871
Well then. I'll happily join ya, Jun.

175
00:10:31,871 --> 00:10:32,692
Okay!

176
00:10:34,197 --> 00:10:36,581
Metal Cardbot! Change Up!

177
00:10:50,886 --> 00:10:53,659
Deep Bite! Sealed!

178
00:10:54,312 --> 00:10:56,851
I'll happily accept you too, Deep Bite.

179
00:10:56,851 --> 00:10:57,693
Well done, Jun!

00:10:57,693 --> 00:10:59,722
We have another friend on board!

181
00:10:59,722 --> 00:11:00,657
Yeah!

182
00:11:03,187 --> 00:11:05,619
That kid sure is something.

183
00:11:07,287 --> 00:11:10,730
So... surely you have plans to clean this mess up.

184
00:11:10,730 --> 00:11:13,486
Isn't that right, DI-REC-TOR?!

185
00:11:14,176 --> 00:11:16,559
I TOLD YOU COUNTLESS TIMES TO STOP MAKING TROUBLE FOR ME!!!

186
00:11:16,559 --> 00:11:18,557
I'M SORRY!!!
