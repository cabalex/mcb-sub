1
00:00:01,891 --> 00:00:05,296
It's Okay, Rock Crush

2
00:00:09,323 --> 00:00:16,620
Just when I thought I'd found a place that's nice and quiet... Why can't they just leave me alone?

3
00:00:17,189 --> 00:00:17,748
Huh?

4
00:00:25,768 --> 00:00:28,396
Oi Oi! Relax! I'm a friend!

5
00:00:28,396 --> 00:00:32,279
L-Liar! I don't have any friends!

6
00:00:32,798 --> 00:00:36,332
Just listen to what I have to say!!

7
00:00:39,529 --> 00:00:42,871
Let's be friends, one loner to another!

8
00:00:46,509 --> 00:00:49,264
Soooo, this is, uh... this goes here, and...

9
00:00:49,264 --> 00:00:50,670
Whatcha doing?

10
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:53,768
Homework. We have to solve 10 pages of fractional number problems-

11
00:00:53,768 --> 00:00:55,612
AARGH! I can't take this anymore!!

12
00:00:55,612 --> 00:00:58,286
Cheer up. You can't give up now.

13
00:00:58,286 --> 00:00:59,960
Yeah. Build up your patience.

14
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:01,0
Gimme that.

15
00:01:03,112 --> 00:01:04,239
Done!

16
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:04,628
She's fast!

17
00:01:04,628 --> 00:01:05,483
No kidding!

18
00:01:05,623 --> 00:01:07,358
You solved all of that already?

19
00:01:07,358 --> 00:01:08,858
I'm even considered to be among the slowest students in my village.

20
00:01:08,858 --> 00:01:09,593
Delete.

21
00:01:09,593 --> 00:01:11,584
Hey! Why did you do that?!

22
00:01:11,584 --> 00:01:13,135
You need to do your homework for yourself.
Hello, Dad. 

23
00:01:13,135 --> 00:01:16,989
I'm doing homework with my friends.

24
00:01:16,989 --> 00:01:20,129
Breaking news: We have an update on the recent sinkhole occurrences in the center of Mowtown. 

25
00:01:20,129 --> 00:01:25,780
Fortunately, there are no casualties yet, but Mayor Jacques-
Sinkhole occurrences... Reminds me of Dexter.

26
00:01:25,780 --> 00:01:27,902
Okay. I'll be careful.

27
00:01:27,902 --> 00:01:29,361
Did he say anything about all the sinkholes?

28
00:01:29,361 --> 00:01:33,271
Yeah. We don't know how or why it's happening yet, so he wants me to come home as soon as possible.

29
00:01:33,271 --> 00:01:34,656
Wait, that geyser...

30
00:01:34,656 --> 00:01:37,331
Argh! Yeah, my head is about to explode like a geyser!

31
00:01:37,331 --> 00:01:43,843
I'm not talking about your head! The place on the news where the water main broke... is the same tunnel we went through the other day.

32
00:01:43,843 --> 00:01:44,871
Then that must mean...

33
00:01:44,871 --> 00:01:45,799
Rock Crush?!

34
00:01:45,799 --> 00:01:47,234
Did I miss something while I was away?

35
00:01:47,234 --> 00:01:48,883
Ah, well...

36
00:01:49,228 --> 00:01:57,890
Here we have a map of central Mowtown. These X marks are the places where the sinkholes occurred. Let me display these in chronological order...

37
00:01:57,890 --> 00:01:59,906
So he's traveling underground.

38
00:01:59,906 --> 00:02:05,200
If we trace its path, his destination in the next hour will be... here.

39
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,983
Th... this is... OUR RESTAURANT!

40
00:02:08,282 --> 00:02:09,931
I hoped it wasn't...

41
00:02:09,931 --> 00:02:12,967
(If that happens...)

42
00:02:12,967 --> 00:02:16,627
AAAAH!! What should I do?!?

43
00:02:17,128 --> 00:02:18,120
Stay calm, Jun.

44
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:19,978
Let's head towards the scene first.

45
00:02:21,768 --> 00:02:24,204
Don't you worry. We'll solve this problem together.

46
00:02:24,204 --> 00:02:25,252
We're ready, Blue Cop!

47
00:02:25,252 --> 00:02:25,829
Alright!

48
00:02:27,572 --> 00:02:29,437
Jun! Your homework--
Excuse me!

49
00:02:29,437 --> 00:02:31,180
Ah, yes sir. Coming right up!

50
00:02:38,461 --> 00:02:39,697
Where are we?

51
00:02:40,174 --> 00:02:45,836
A thoroughfare road that's under construction. Rock Crush will have to pass through here to get to the Milky Way.

52
00:02:46,824 --> 00:02:47,692
Is that...?

53
00:02:47,692 --> 00:02:48,586
Over there!

54
00:02:53,679 --> 00:02:56,365
Huh? I'm out in the open.

55
00:02:56,365 --> 00:02:57,723
That's Rock Crush?

56
00:02:57,723 --> 00:02:59,187
I knew it was you!

57
00:02:59,187 --> 00:03:02,408
It's strange. He never wanted to come outside before, but now...

58
00:03:02,408 --> 00:03:04,377
Uh, uh... it's dangerous! I'm going--

59
00:03:04,377 --> 00:03:06,530
Shut up! Keep it moving!

60
00:03:06,530 --> 00:03:07,389
That voice!

61
00:03:07,389 --> 00:03:08,467
Red Blitz!

62
00:03:08,467 --> 00:03:12,400
Eh? Oh ho! You came right to me!

63
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,478
Why are you here?!

64
00:03:13,478 --> 00:03:17,110
Isn't it obvious? To bury you into the ground!

65
00:03:17,110 --> 00:03:19,568
Don't say scary things like that!

66
00:03:19,568 --> 00:03:22,298
So all those sinkholes happened because of you!

67
00:03:22,298 --> 00:03:25,812
You're going to destroy the Milky Way by using your friend like a tool?! You coward!

68
00:03:25,812 --> 00:03:26,795
Co-Coward?

69
00:03:26,795 --> 00:03:27,971
I'm not his friend, though...

70
00:03:27,971 --> 00:03:31,625
Enough talk! Just give me your Metal Breath if you want your precious burger joint to stay safe!

71
00:03:31,966 --> 00:03:33,312
Not gonna happen!

72
00:03:33,312 --> 00:03:37,679
I see what's going on. Rock Crush is most likely being fooled by Red Blitz.

73
00:03:37,679 --> 00:03:42,348
Maybe Red convinced him that he can go back to his quiet life if they have the Metal Breath or something.

74
00:03:42,348 --> 00:03:43,334
He's the worst.

75
00:03:43,334 --> 00:03:45,829
Rock Crush! Everything he told you is a lie!

76
00:03:45,829 --> 00:03:47,377
What do you mean?

77
00:03:47,377 --> 00:03:50,824
Don't ask questions! All you have to do is follow my orders!

78
00:03:50,824 --> 00:03:53,545
OW! My foot!!
Sorry...

79
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:56,937
Don't just sit there and apologize! Go take 'em down first!

80
00:03:56,937 --> 00:03:57,781
O-okay!

81
00:04:00,846 --> 00:04:01,751
Blizzard...

82
00:04:01,751 --> 00:04:03,568
That's...! Blue Cop!

83
00:04:03,568 --> 00:04:03,853
Roger!

84
00:04:09,389 --> 00:04:11,318
Star Rising Shot!

85
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:18,365
He's getting away!

86
00:04:18,365 --> 00:04:19,711
Wait, no he isn't!

87
00:04:23,790 --> 00:04:25,632
Don't get too cocky!

88
00:04:27,427 --> 00:04:27,985
Blue Cop!

89
00:04:27,985 --> 00:04:29,917
Rock Crush! Now- Eh? 

90
00:04:30,709 --> 00:04:34,120
HEY!! What are you doing?! Get out of there!!

91
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:36,247
Their teamwork is terrible.

92
00:04:36,247 --> 00:04:37,540
Good thing for us.

93
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:40,691
Get him to fight outside of this tunnel. It's getting stuffy in here.

94
00:04:40,691 --> 00:04:42,879
We can't come out and fight because this place is too small.

95
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:44,435
I know, but...

96
00:04:44,435 --> 00:04:47,783
You said you wanted to live a quiet life! So fight for it!!

97
00:04:47,783 --> 00:04:49,197
I don't wanna!

98
00:04:57,418 --> 00:04:58,100
Jun!

99
00:04:58,653 --> 00:04:59,761
Is that...

100
00:04:59,761 --> 00:05:00,473
Glober?!

101
00:05:00,473 --> 00:05:04,310
Ha Ha! The Metal Breath now belongs to Glober! (FX-sarcasm)

102
00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:05,543
WHAT?!

103
00:05:05,543 --> 00:05:06,766
Ciao~! (FX-sarcasm)

104
00:05:07,737 --> 00:05:08,370
Jun!

105
00:05:08,370 --> 00:05:09,259
After him!

106
00:05:11,439 --> 00:05:12,252
They're gone?

107
00:05:13,908 --> 00:05:14,838
Stop right there!

108
00:05:19,959 --> 00:05:21,701
Say hello to Jones.

109
00:05:21,701 --> 00:05:26,564
Since when have you been after the Metal Breath? The world is full of untrustworthy people.

110
00:05:26,564 --> 00:05:30,917
You're one quick-tempered fella. That's why your perception is all blurry.

111
00:05:30,917 --> 00:05:31,360
What?!

112
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,920
Wha... Aha! So that's what's up!

113
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:34,956
That's what's up.

114
00:05:34,956 --> 00:05:36,377
What's up?!

115
00:05:36,377 --> 00:05:37,661
Don't tell me... It was bait?

116
00:05:37,661 --> 00:05:42,639
I snatched the Metal Breath so that red guy will come after us with his eyes lit up like headlights, yeah?

117
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:46,913
We will lure away Red Blitz, and you, Blue Cop, will go stop Rock Crush.

118
00:05:46,913 --> 00:05:47,665
We?

119
00:05:47,665 --> 00:05:50,353
He has a talent for making friends with everyone.

120
00:05:50,353 --> 00:05:52,177
That's Jun's specialty.

121
00:05:52,177 --> 00:05:53,584
I think so too.

122
00:05:53,584 --> 00:05:55,264
Alrighty! Let's roll!

123
00:05:56,271 --> 00:06:00,898
This is Mowtown police! This location is at risk of a sinkhole occurrence! Please evacuate immediately!

124
00:06:05,281 --> 00:06:06,252
He's here!

125
00:06:09,485 --> 00:06:12,189
Gimme that boy and his Metal Breath!

126
00:06:12,189 --> 00:06:15,228
Aaaahhh~ Let me go already! (FX-sarcasm)

127
00:06:15,228 --> 00:06:16,384
Let me gooo! (FX-sarcasm)

128
00:06:16,384 --> 00:06:18,384
O-of course not! (FX-sarcasm)

129
00:06:18,384 --> 00:06:21,235
That twerp...! Stop right there!

130
00:06:21,826 --> 00:06:24,259
He took the bait!
Wow.

131
00:06:24,259 --> 00:06:25,480
You guys get off here.

132
00:06:25,778 --> 00:06:27,345
Wait for me!

133
00:06:27,810 --> 00:06:31,636
Rock Crush, stop! You shouldn't believe everything Red Blitz says!

134
00:06:31,636 --> 00:06:33,677
It's none of your business!

135
00:06:34,716 --> 00:06:36,165
No, Rock Crush!

136
00:06:36,396 --> 00:06:37,625
You can do it, Blue Cop!

137
00:06:37,625 --> 00:06:38,915
Be careful!

138
00:06:39,197 --> 00:06:42,831
We need to lead him far away from the Milky Way... I mean, away from a crowded place full of people!

139
00:06:42,831 --> 00:06:44,134
I got it.

140
00:06:44,584 --> 00:06:47,139
You think you can get away from me?!

141
00:06:48,225 --> 00:06:51,447
My speed and horsepower are second to none!

142
00:06:51,447 --> 00:06:54,526
But, I bet you've never seen anything like this!

143
00:06:57,497 --> 00:06:58,819
Dang it!

144
00:07:01,836 --> 00:07:06,454
Is it here? No, here? Waaahh! Don't leave me alone out here!

145
00:07:06,653 --> 00:07:08,218
Rock Crush, stop!

146
00:07:09,661 --> 00:07:11,540
I can't see anything!

147
00:07:11,855 --> 00:07:13,841
Rock Crush! Look ahead! Ahead!

148
00:07:19,648 --> 00:07:20,843
We lost him, right?

149
00:07:20,843 --> 00:07:23,822
Yup. And looks like that park over there is nice and empty.

150
00:07:24,937 --> 00:07:27,362
Wait! That's my burger joint!!

151
00:07:27,362 --> 00:07:29,254
Oh? This was your place?

152
00:07:29,254 --> 00:07:30,300
Quick, we have to get out of here!

153
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:32,353
But we gotta follow the traffic lights.

154
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:37,716
Heh! Found ya!

155
00:07:44,762 --> 00:07:48,314
That noise... That way!

156
00:07:51,442 --> 00:07:52,538
I found you!

157
00:07:52,538 --> 00:07:53,665
You're late!

158
00:07:55,365 --> 00:07:57,324
Huh? Glober?

159
00:07:57,324 --> 00:08:02,783
Final warning! Give me your Metal Breath, or I'll tear this place down!

160
00:08:02,783 --> 00:08:09,848
I'm not gonna let you do whatever you want! I won't hand over this Metal Breath, and I'll protect my burger joint too! 

161
00:08:09,848 --> 00:08:12,387
And! I'll be taking Rock Crush with me!

162
00:08:12,810 --> 00:08:13,908
Huh?
What?!

163
00:08:14,108 --> 00:08:15,680
You can do that?

164
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:20,480
Of course! So lend me your strength. Please!

165
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:23,891
Good grief. Very well!

166
00:08:25,177 --> 00:08:28,206
So that's how it's gonna be, huh?!

167
00:08:30,651 --> 00:08:32,668
Cielo! Set up!

168
00:08:34,437 --> 00:08:36,326
I was getting sick of waiting! 

169
00:08:38,134 --> 00:08:41,134
Enough messing around. Come with us, Red Blitz!

170
00:08:42,187 --> 00:08:47,375
I don't wanna' hear it! Rock Crush! If you're that scared, just keep your eyes shut and follow me!

171
00:08:47,375 --> 00:08:48,605
Bu-but...

172
00:08:48,605 --> 00:08:49,548
Hurry!

173
00:08:49,548 --> 00:08:50,417
Okay!

174
00:08:50,417 --> 00:08:51,402
Stop!

175
00:08:53,798 --> 00:08:54,375
You're up, Glober!

176
00:08:54,375 --> 00:08:55,875
Sure thing!

177
00:08:57,523 --> 00:08:59,980
Thunder Whip!

178
00:09:13,571 --> 00:09:18,513
Rock Crush! It's okay now! you don’t have to listen to what Red Blitz says anymore!

179

181
00:09:30,524 --> 00:09:32,557

Dreadnought Storm!

184
00:09:36,812 --> 00:09:41,346
Running away from your fears won't solve anything! Let us help you!

185
00:09:41,346 --> 00:09:45,354
Don't listen to him! He'll just take advantage of you!

186
00:09:45,354 --> 00:09:47,495
What should I do?!

187
00:09:47,495 --> 00:09:49,610
Believe in me! Cielo!

188
00:09:49,610 --> 00:09:50,850
'Scuse me!

189
00:09:52,143 --> 00:09:56,100
Jun is not the person you think he is! I promise you that!

190
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:57,947
Nooo!

191
00:09:59,249 --> 00:10:00,767
Glober!

192
00:10:00,988 --> 00:10:03,243
It's okay, Rock Crush.

193
00:10:05,322 --> 00:10:06,653
Musclehyde! Now!

194
00:10:06,653 --> 00:10:09,269
It'll be over in a moment, Rock Crush!

195
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:13,586
Metal Cardbot, change up!

196
00:10:27,759 --> 00:10:29,956
Rock Crush, sealed!

197
00:10:32,844 --> 00:10:37,855
I should've found him sooner than I did... Take good care of Rock Crush, for my sake.

198
00:10:37,855 --> 00:10:40,615
Of course. Thanks for the help, Glober!

199
00:10:40,615 --> 00:10:41,807
By the way, where's Red Blitz?

200
00:10:41,807 --> 00:10:42,969
Ah...

201
00:10:43,471 --> 00:10:46,230
You'll pay triple for that!!

202
00:10:46,230 --> 00:10:49,331
Uh... I'll see you again... somewhere!

203
00:10:49,331 --> 00:10:50,306
Hey!

204
00:10:52,312 --> 00:10:54,200
Blue Cop! Guys!

205
00:10:55,903 --> 00:10:57,341
You did well.

206
00:10:57,677 --> 00:10:59,225
What happened?

207
00:10:59,225 --> 00:11:01,321
Now, now. Let's get back to work.

208
00:11:01,321 --> 00:11:05,379
Ahahaha...
Thank you again.

209
00:11:05,778 --> 00:11:07,100
Drill!

210
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:08,278
Cool!

211
00:11:08,278 --> 00:11:10,114
I'm supposed to be the coolest one here!

212
00:11:10,114 --> 00:11:10,917
Cielo...

213
00:11:10,917 --> 00:11:12,750
Hey, quiet down.

214
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:13,173
They don't know "cool".

215
00:11:13,173 --> 00:11:14,192
They're children.

216
00:11:14,192 --> 00:11:16,149
Big bro! I wanna ride it!

217
00:11:16,149 --> 00:11:18,105
I'm sorry, you can't.

218
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:25,287
Woaaah! So cool!!

219
00:11:26,384 --> 00:11:29,354
Getting along with others isn't as bad as you thought, right?

220
00:11:29,354 --> 00:11:31,889
Yeah, I suppose it's not.

221
00:11:33,349 --> 00:11:34,644
Again!

222
00:11:34,644 --> 00:11:37,479
You got it! This time in reverse!
