1
00:00:01,940 --> 00:00:04,533
Fair and Square! Vector and Bit Brothers

2
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:11,64
A steel giant came from an alien planet to challenge humanity....

3
00:00:11,64 --> 00:00:14,470
Good grief. What a troublesome pair.

4
00:00:14,470 --> 00:00:15,682
Alien robot, it says! An alien robot!

5
00:00:15,682 --> 00:00:17,787
You mean those monsters that seem to appear out of nowhere these days?

6
00:00:17,787 --> 00:00:19,541
Yeah! Metal Cardbots, I think?

7
00:00:19,541 --> 00:00:22,139
It says they came to Earth because their planet Machina exploded.

8
00:00:22,139 --> 00:00:25,193
You actually believe that kind of news? That setting is so clichÃ©!

9
00:00:25,193 --> 00:00:27,193
Wow, it feels strange to read newspapers in this era.

10
00:00:27,193 --> 00:00:28,663
Today's Mowtown Times, please.

11
00:00:28,663 --> 00:00:29,602
Here you go.

12
00:00:29,602 --> 00:00:35,212
Hahahaha! We're about to make ten times our usual sales thanks to this article!

13
00:00:35,212 --> 00:00:38,621
Tomorrow's front page will also be about Metal Cardbots! Schedule the next interview!

14
00:00:38,921 --> 00:00:40,655
Well, actually...

15
00:00:40,655 --> 00:00:41,247
Eh?

16
00:00:41,777 --> 00:00:43,801
You never asked for the robot's contact information?!

17
00:00:43,801 --> 00:00:45,767
I didn't have time for that!

18
00:00:45,767 --> 00:00:49,469
Then find a way to contact him! Don't bother showing your face in this office until you reach him!

19
00:00:51,621 --> 00:00:53,405
It's no use.

20
00:00:53,405 --> 00:00:57,990
There's no way we can just browse the internet for a way to contact Hidden Cardbots.

21
00:00:57,990 --> 00:00:59,929
Speaking of which, what's your plan after we contact them?

22
00:00:59,929 --> 00:01:00,786
Of course we'll-

23
00:01:00,786 --> 00:01:03,00
Of course we're going to have a revenge battle!!

24
00:01:03,00 --> 00:01:05,778
Okay! We'll beat them up for sure this time!

25
00:01:05,778 --> 00:01:06,950
We're not going to do that.

26
00:01:06,950 --> 00:01:12,350
Those guys were strong enough to beat you before. What if you end up losing again?

27
00:01:12,350 --> 00:01:14,257
Argh, I wasn't in peak performance!

28
00:01:14,257 --> 00:01:16,141
Alright, let's just calm down...

29
00:01:16,141 --> 00:01:17,817
Then why are you trying to contact them?

30
00:01:17,817 --> 00:01:21,751
We have to teach them that they shouldn't be seen in public, don't you think?

31
00:01:21,751 --> 00:01:25,379
He's right. If we leave the Hidden Cardbots alone, something even worse could happen.

32
00:01:25,379 --> 00:01:29,368
But if someone gets hurt during that time, the coexistence of humans and Metal Cardbots could be-

33
00:01:29,368 --> 00:01:30,942
Let me handle that.

34
00:01:31,341 --> 00:01:34,30
Glober! How long have you been eavesdropping?

35
00:01:34,30 --> 00:01:36,259
I'm always by your side.

36
00:01:36,259 --> 00:01:37,626
Hi, Glober!

37
00:01:38,325 --> 00:01:42,468
Answer me, bro! What were you thinking when you did that?!

38
00:01:42,468 --> 00:01:45,200
(Sparking Force...!)

39
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,492
Don't tell me you did it...

40
00:01:46,492 --> 00:01:47,516
(Knuckle!!)

41
00:01:47,516 --> 00:01:50,520
...because you thought I'd somehow lose!

42
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:53,50
It's not like that. I won't interrupt you any longer.

43
00:01:53,50 --> 00:01:54,695
You better keep your word!

44
00:01:56,996 --> 00:02:00,387
Man. You always interrupt me and it makes my stomach turn, right when I'm having some real fun and-

45
00:02:00,387 --> 00:02:06,352
(Do you have any idea how terrified I was that you might lose, you foolish little brother?!) (FX-italic)

46
00:02:06,352 --> 00:02:06,799
Huh?

47
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:07,265
Hm?

48
00:02:07,265 --> 00:02:07,742
Huh?

49
00:02:07,742 --> 00:02:08,936
Hm? What?

50
00:02:08,936 --> 00:02:10,125
Ugh, nothing...

51
00:02:10,125 --> 00:02:12,115
Woah! I almost tripped over myself.

52
00:02:12,115 --> 00:02:15,407
(That's exactly why I can't leave you alone!) (FX-italic)

53
00:02:15,407 --> 00:02:17,447
What a peculiar brotherhood.

54
00:02:18,747 --> 00:02:24,361
Flying to thy heart. Many thanks for bidding Pure White Wings Sky Gallop Transportation Service. How may I help thou?

55
00:02:24,361 --> 00:02:26,354
Hey. It's me, Glober.

56
00:02:26,354 --> 00:02:28,360
Eh? What the- They hung up!

57
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:29,288
Again! Again!

58
00:02:30,272 --> 00:02:33,478
Flying to thy heart. Many thanks for bidding Pure White Wings Sky Gallop Transportation Servi-

59
00:02:33,478 --> 00:02:34,383
It's me again.

60
00:02:34,383 --> 00:02:37,829
Did I not compose it clearly enough that thou art permanently banned? Never bid me aga-

61
00:02:37,829 --> 00:02:39,441
Oi, wait wait wait!

62
00:02:39,441 --> 00:02:43,652
I'm trying to introduce you to your new client! You'll be transporting a very interesting client to a very interesting place!

63
00:02:43,652 --> 00:02:46,432
Interesting client? Who, to where?

64
00:02:46,432 --> 00:02:51,394
A Star Guardian, to the place where the Flash Vector and Spark Bit brothers are!

65
00:02:51,394 --> 00:02:54,139
Hmmm... A Star Guardian...

66
00:02:54,139 --> 00:02:56,729
Yeah. He wants a duel with those two brothers.

67
00:02:56,729 --> 00:02:58,197
Wait, we're not going to fight them!

68
00:02:58,197 --> 00:02:58,879
Shhh!

69
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:00,835
Very well. Allow me to contemplate this.

70
00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:05,900
Will they really show up?

71
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:07,30
Don't worry.

72
00:03:07,30 --> 00:03:11,240
Not only does Sky Gallop enjoy partaking in a good duel, but they also like to watch others duel.

73
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:13,479
I don't want to fight them...

74
00:03:14,217 --> 00:03:15,705
Guys! Over there!

75
00:03:16,204 --> 00:03:17,620
They're here.

76
00:03:21,549 --> 00:03:28,157
Oh, my lady Peruru. I brought some purple pansies for thee. In the language of flowers, pansies symbolize eternal promise-

77
00:03:28,157 --> 00:03:29,201
Th-Thank you...

78
00:03:29,201 --> 00:03:30,323
There's no time for that!

79
00:03:30,323 --> 00:03:32,216
It smells so good!

80
00:03:32,216 --> 00:03:33,437
You want it?

81
00:03:33,437 --> 00:03:34,164
- N-no thanks...
- Thanks for coming.

82
00:03:34,164 --> 00:03:34,564
- N-no thanks...
- Thanks for coming.

83
00:03:34,564 --> 00:03:37,978
I assume thou art Blue Cop, The sole survivor amongst the Star Guardians.

84
00:03:37,978 --> 00:03:39,429
Formerly a Star Guardian, yes.

85
00:03:39,429 --> 00:03:40,932
Okay, now take us to them!

86
00:03:40,932 --> 00:03:44,228
Thou art a short-tempered one. There is a condition for thy transportation.

87
00:03:44,228 --> 00:03:45,280
A condition?

88
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,500
Young sir, master of the Star Guardian,

89
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:52,120
thou shall leave all thy Metal Breath-sealed servants hither. That is the condition.

90
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:53,223
S-servants?!

91
00:03:53,223 --> 00:03:54,849
We're not servants!

92
00:03:54,849 --> 00:03:55,918
Wait, are we?

93
00:03:55,918 --> 00:03:56,920
Of course not.

94
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:59,134
You think Jun will accept that kind of condition?!

95
00:03:59,134 --> 00:04:01,203
That wasn't part of the deal, Sky Gallop!

96
00:04:01,203 --> 00:04:04,347
The original summons was for transporting the Star Guardian.

97
00:04:04,347 --> 00:04:09,691
Above all, a duel should be fair and square. To have someone else step in and interfere with the duel is... 

98
00:04:09,691 --> 00:04:11,947
Absolutely! Unacceptable!

99
00:04:11,947 --> 00:04:13,615
But I can come along too, right?

100
00:04:13,615 --> 00:04:16,319
Thou art a paying customer, so thou may join us.

101
00:04:16,319 --> 00:04:17,872
But this shall be the last time.

102
00:04:17,872 --> 00:04:18,468
O-okay...

103
00:04:18,468 --> 00:04:20,600
Looks like we have no choice.

104
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:21,898
We'll take care of them.

105
00:04:21,898 --> 00:04:22,389
Yeah!

106
00:04:22,389 --> 00:04:23,740
Come back soon.

107
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:25,209
Then it is decided.

108
00:04:26,418 --> 00:04:27,774
Bon voyage!

109
00:04:27,774 --> 00:04:29,992
Kick their butts!

110
00:04:33,932 --> 00:04:35,950
The airplane shall be landing soon.

111
00:04:35,950 --> 00:04:39,569
Lady Peruru and other passengers, prepare to disembark.

112
00:04:39,569 --> 00:04:42,843
One million thirty-two, one million thirty-four, one million-

113
00:04:44,242 --> 00:04:48,415
They always leave and come back without telling me. Take me with you sometime!

114
00:04:49,159 --> 00:04:51,665
This is it. The Hidden Cardbot's hideout...!

115
00:04:52,266 --> 00:04:53,346
It's the Star Guardian!

116
00:04:53,346 --> 00:04:55,129
So he was the one you said you were bringing along...

117
00:04:55,129 --> 00:04:55,848
They said that?

118
00:04:55,848 --> 00:04:57,430
You heard it while right beside me!

119
00:04:57,430 --> 00:04:58,115
Ah, heheheh...

120
00:04:58,115 --> 00:05:02,545
I saw your interview, Spark Bit. I came here because I wanted to talk to you.

121
00:05:02,545 --> 00:05:07,355
Talk to me? Ha! I want to beat up the Star Guardian, which is you!

122
00:05:07,355 --> 00:05:09,822
If you wanna talk to me, do it after you beat me!

123
00:05:09,822 --> 00:05:12,910
If it's what you truly want, so be it.

124
00:05:12,910 --> 00:05:16,399
But, if I win, you'll get sealed by Jun.

125
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:19,223
That's a ridiculous condition. You don't have to listen to-

126
00:05:19,223 --> 00:05:23,850
Fine! But if I win, leave me alone so I can live freely!

127
00:05:23,850 --> 00:05:24,778
Agreed.

128
00:05:24,778 --> 00:05:26,692
Hm. And thus the match has been set.

129
00:05:26,992 --> 00:05:28,504
Is this why you brought them here?

130
00:05:28,504 --> 00:05:34,737
Let us watch this broil, to observe if the Star Guardian's power is still intact here on Earth.

131
00:05:34,737 --> 00:05:36,425
Don't you dare lose.

132
00:05:36,425 --> 00:05:37,519
I always win!

133
00:05:38,189 --> 00:05:44,242
Now then, Lady Peruru, please take this seat. The rest of thou, sit wherever thy want.

134
00:05:46,143 --> 00:05:48,339
Let's do this fair and square.

135
00:05:48,339 --> 00:05:53,889
Fair and square, huh?! That's one of my favorite sayings! Heheh!

136
00:05:54,288 --> 00:05:56,834
Alright! Let's do this!

137
00:05:56,834 --> 00:05:58,362
Blue Cop, I'm counting on you!

138
00:05:58,362 --> 00:05:59,704
I'm counting on you too, Jun.

139
00:06:00,504 --> 00:06:02,475
Blue Cop S! Set Up!

140
00:06:22,168 --> 00:06:25,514
Let's attack first! Blue Cop! Star Rising Shot!

141
00:06:28,692 --> 00:06:29,713
He's so fast!

142
00:06:29,713 --> 00:06:33,459
Don't just use that pea shooter like a coward! Use your fists!

143
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:34,966
Like this!

144
00:06:34,966 --> 00:06:36,451
One more time!

145
00:06:40,502 --> 00:06:43,069
Heheh! It should've been this way from the start!

146
00:06:48,990 --> 00:06:50,987
Blue Cop! Blast him up and away!

147
00:06:56,495 --> 00:06:57,468
Now!

148
00:06:58,569 --> 00:07:00,288
Supernova Smash!!

149
00:07:04,519 --> 00:07:10,451
Now it's my turn! Sparking Force... Knuckle!!

150
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:20,646
(Sparking Force Knuckle is an inescapable technique that unleashes six, no, sixty, no, six hundred fists in a single second! You're doing great, my little brother!) (FX-italic)

151
00:07:24,278 --> 00:07:26,870
That Star Guardian... He's blocking every hit!

152
00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:29,475
Don't underestimate Blue Cop's Palm Protection!

153
00:07:35,641 --> 00:07:41,0
So far, so good... but I might need to lend Blue Cop a hand. 

154
00:07:41,0 --> 00:07:44,730
If I leave these guys be, they're going to become a nuisance to me- 

155
00:07:44,730 --> 00:07:45,360
What the-?!

156
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:49,180
This is a fair and square duel. I won't forgive you if you interfere.

157
00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:51,132
Okay, okay!

158
00:07:51,132 --> 00:07:55,694
(Did you see me, little brother? I caught a cowardly saboteur for you...) (FX-italic)

159
00:07:55,694 --> 00:08:01,740
(Huh? Ah... You didn't see me... That's okay, I won't let anyone interfere with you, so you can fight fair and square!) (FX-italic)

160
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:03,329
...can you let me go now?

161
00:08:06,103 --> 00:08:09,896
Sky Gallop Transportation Service is closed today. Call again another time.

162
00:08:09,896 --> 00:08:10,841
Hm?

163
00:08:10,841 --> 00:08:12,411
You may continue.

164
00:08:24,706 --> 00:08:27,355
Tch! This keeps getting more and more exciting!

165
00:08:29,521 --> 00:08:33,375
(No. No way! It's the same situation... As before!) (FX-italic)

166
00:08:34,673 --> 00:08:36,220
Just stay down already!

167
00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:39,729
I told you, I'll strike you down with all my heart and soul!

168
00:08:40,427 --> 00:08:44,264
With all your heart and soul, eh? That's one of my favorite sayings!

169
00:08:44,264 --> 00:08:46,432
Tch. This keeps getting more and more exciting!

170
00:08:46,432 --> 00:08:48,125
The feeling is mutual!

171
00:08:57,942 --> 00:09:01,331
It's been a while since I burnt myself out like this.

172
00:09:01,331 --> 00:09:02,990
For me, this is the first time.

173
00:09:03,668 --> 00:09:05,177
Okay, I've decided!

174
00:09:06,269 --> 00:09:09,754
Flash Vector is now my big brother, and I'm his little brother!

175
00:09:09,754 --> 00:09:11,293
I'm... Your big brother?

176
00:09:11,293 --> 00:09:14,264
Of course! 'Cause I fell down first.

177
00:09:15,177 --> 00:09:18,772
Hmph. I only held myself up a second longer than you.

178
00:09:19,672 --> 00:09:27,600
(He's enjoying this fight as much as the other time! This is really bad! If it continues like this, he'll make that Star Guardian his brother too!) (FX-italic)

179
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,139
(And if that happens, I'm-) (FX-italic)

180
00:09:29,139 --> 00:09:29,570
(No.) (FX-italic)

181
00:09:29,570 --> 00:09:30,249
(NO.) (FX-italic)

182
00:09:30,249 --> 00:09:30,687
(NO!) (FX-italic xl)

183
00:09:30,687 --> 00:09:32,128
(NOOOO!!!) (FX-italic xxl)

184
00:09:32,826 --> 00:09:33,605
Uh?

185
00:09:44,979 --> 00:09:45,653
Blue Cop!

186
00:09:45,653 --> 00:09:48,379
You coward! You said to keep this fight fair and square!

187
00:09:48,379 --> 00:09:51,375
I-it wasn't me! Bro! What the heck was that all about?!

188
00:09:51,375 --> 00:09:53,418
It's... It's not what you think, Spark Bit.

189
00:09:53,418 --> 00:09:56,562
(I-I un-unintentionally threw it! It's-It's not what you think!) (FX-italic)

190
00:09:56,562 --> 00:09:59,633
(H-hey. What's with... that look in your eyes?!) (FX-italic)

191
00:09:59,633 --> 00:10:02,604
(D-DON'T LOOK AT ME LIKE THAT!!) (FX-italic bold)

192
00:10:04,466 --> 00:10:05,293
Blue Cop!

193
00:10:05,893 --> 00:10:07,201
Capture Whip!

194
00:10:10,283 --> 00:10:11,706
Sky Gallop! Hurry!!

195
00:10:11,706 --> 00:10:13,408
We shall meet later.

196
00:10:13,408 --> 00:10:15,509
Allow me to handle this, my Lady Peruru!

197
00:10:20,715 --> 00:10:24,370
Thou would cheat in front of lady Peruru, let alone myself.

198
00:10:24,370 --> 00:10:27,225
A duel that goes against the spirit of chivalry is invalid!

199
00:10:33,418 --> 00:10:34,147
Channel three?

200
00:10:35,134 --> 00:10:37,739
Ah, Mr. Mayor! How may I help you?

201
00:10:37,739 --> 00:10:41,682
I ask that you refrain from making a fuss over a single article of questionable authenticity.

202
00:10:41,682 --> 00:10:44,840
Excuse me? What are you- It's on the evening paper?!

203
00:10:45,639 --> 00:10:46,293
Eh?!

204
00:10:46,293 --> 00:10:49,951
Apparently, yesterday's press conference and shark scare were all for promoting a movie.

205
00:10:49,951 --> 00:10:52,831
W-w-wait! Hello?! Mr. Mayor?! Hey!!

206
00:10:52,831 --> 00:10:53,658
Chief editor!

207
00:10:54,158 --> 00:10:54,932
What?!

208
00:10:55,334 --> 00:10:58,788
We're terribly sorry. We didn't know it was a movie promotion...

209
00:10:58,788 --> 00:11:03,500
I-i-i-it was all just... To promote a movie?!?!

210
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:05,940
Metal Cardbot VS Sharknado...

211
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:08,378
Is it really okay to make up a fake advertisement like this?

212
00:11:08,378 --> 00:11:11,316
This is probably the only way to resolve all the commotion from yesterday.

213
00:11:11,316 --> 00:11:13,460
This movie isn't actually coming out, right?

214
00:11:13,460 --> 00:11:16,403
It's not uncommon for a movie to be cancelled in the middle of production.

215
00:11:16,403 --> 00:11:21,951
But, that doesn't solve the Hidden Cardbot problem. What do you plan to do about them?

216
00:11:21,951 --> 00:11:23,173
What should I do...

217
00:11:24,875 --> 00:11:27,710
Bro! You told me you wouldn't do that again!

218
00:11:27,710 --> 00:11:30,946
What was that for, huh?! Answer me, now!

219
00:11:31,745 --> 00:11:34,769
We have a guest. It seems he would care to form an alliance with us.

220
00:11:35,369 --> 00:11:40,269
So you wish to defeat the Star Guardian? Allow me to help you.
