Exclusive! Steel Reporter

2
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:11,127
What's with this weather? Right when we're in the middle of carrying some valuable treasure.

3
00:00:11,127 --> 00:00:15,153
Be careful. 'Cause when we deliver this thing, we'll be millionaires!

4
00:00:15,153 --> 00:00:17,280
Heh. Don't worry 'bout it!

5
00:00:20,684 --> 00:00:23,602
You're making a mess back there! Fly gently!

6
00:00:23,602 --> 00:00:26,777
Stop yelling at me! You're the one who picked this scrapheap of an airplane!

7
00:00:26,777 --> 00:00:27,754
What did you say?!

8
00:00:33,843 --> 00:00:36,679
It's all getting knocked over!

9
00:00:38,426 --> 00:00:39,518
Dang it!

10
00:00:40,109 --> 00:00:41,819
The- the tablet!

11
00:00:54,890 --> 00:00:57,317
Mmm... Delicious!

12
00:00:57,317 --> 00:00:59,658
One milkshake coming up!

13
00:00:59,658 --> 00:01:03,670
Uncle Johan! Your homemade pickles are the best!

14
00:01:03,670 --> 00:01:05,114
You want mine too?

15
00:01:05,114 --> 00:01:09,153
Hey, wait. Don't dump your pickles on Peruru because you don't like them!

16
00:01:09,153 --> 00:01:11,206
I got busted...

17
00:01:11,206 --> 00:01:13,694
How can you not like these delicious pickles?

18
00:01:13,694 --> 00:01:21,688
Last night, a transport plane over Mowtown crashed in the mountains. There were no casualties, but the cause of the crash is unclear.

19
00:01:21,688 --> 00:01:22,688
Last night, a transport plane over Mowtown crashed in the mountains. There were no casualties, but the cause of the crash is unclear.
Oh, goodness...

20
00:01:22,688 --> 00:01:25,926
There is some suspicion that the incident may be related to the last flying object seen over Mowtown city center, but...

21
00:01:25,926 --> 00:01:28,426
There is some suspicion that the incident may be related to the last flying object seen over Mowtown city center, but...
It's Crest. Hi, Crest!

22
00:01:28,426 --> 00:01:31,986
Jun! I found out where the third Metal Card tablet is!

23
00:01:31,986 --> 00:01:32,646
Where is it?

24
00:01:32,646 --> 00:01:35,990
It's in that transport plane that crashed last night!

25
00:01:41,432 --> 00:01:44,155
He couldn't have gone too far yet.

26
00:01:51,871 --> 00:01:55,810
Just where am I? Ow!

27
00:01:56,456 --> 00:01:59,662
I'm certain this is not the mountain in Porcaca.

28
00:02:01,662 --> 00:02:04,662
What happened while I was asleep?

29
00:02:06,171 --> 00:02:07,721
Huh? That noise...

30
00:02:12,262 --> 00:02:16,812
Phew. I'm saved. I thought I was all alone. Hi there!

31
00:02:16,812 --> 00:02:18,860
Uh, h-hi...

32
00:02:20,187 --> 00:02:21,686
M-m-m-monster!!!!

33
00:02:21,686 --> 00:02:24,122
H-hey! Wait a minute!

34
00:02:24,716 --> 00:02:25,781
What's up with him?

35
00:02:25,781 --> 00:02:28,781
Hey there. Can you tell me where I am?

36
00:02:30,425 --> 00:02:33,961
Are you shy or something? In that case...

37
00:02:33,961 --> 00:02:37,156
Tickletickletickletickletickletickletickle!

38
00:02:39,221 --> 00:02:44,603
Why are you ignoring me? Unless... You're not a Metal Cardbot?!

39
00:02:52,769 --> 00:02:54,372
You're early.

40
00:02:54,372 --> 00:02:55,514
Where's the crash site?

41
00:02:55,514 --> 00:02:57,377
Over this way.

42
00:02:57,377 --> 00:03:01,985
Heeeelp!!

43
00:03:01,985 --> 00:03:04,985
A m-m-monster just showed up!

44
00:03:04,985 --> 00:03:06,393
What? Sir, are you okay?

45
00:03:06,393 --> 00:03:09,211
Excuse meeeeee!

46
00:03:11,211 --> 00:03:14,756
Can you tell me more about that monster in detail?

47
00:03:14,756 --> 00:03:16,466
It's him again.

48
00:03:16,466 --> 00:03:17,300
Who is that?

49
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:22,568
He's a photojournalist for Mowtown Times. The one Vera's dad manages, or something.

50
00:03:22,568 --> 00:03:23,318
Ah...

51
00:03:23,318 --> 00:03:26,699
Excuse me. Here's my business card.

52
00:03:26,699 --> 00:03:28,216
Mowtown Times?

53
00:03:28,509 --> 00:03:31,603
Was that monster a giant robot?

54
00:03:31,603 --> 00:03:34,771
Uhh, come to think of it, it kind of looked like one....

55
00:03:35,182 --> 00:03:36,538
Where did you see it?!

56
00:03:36,538 --> 00:03:38,186
Just around the corner, on this road here.

57
00:03:38,186 --> 00:03:40,472
Do you think by "monster" he means...?

58
00:03:40,472 --> 00:03:42,300
Yeah. I don't feel good about this.

59
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:44,206
Let's hurry.

60
00:03:46,733 --> 00:03:53,115
Ahem! This is reporter Musclehyde from Cardian's Post. Would you care for an interview?

61
00:03:55,759 --> 00:04:01,372
I've never seen a machine like that. Since when did humanity build those things that look exactly like us?

62
00:04:04,157 --> 00:04:08,717
Where is this place? It doesn't look like Porcaca.

63
00:04:10,699 --> 00:04:14,925
Why am I here? Where are my colleagues?

64
00:04:18,134 --> 00:04:20,115
Of course you wouldn't know any of that.

65
00:04:22,170 --> 00:04:23,893
Is someone coming?

66
00:04:27,667 --> 00:04:29,923
This must be the site where he saw that monster, right?

67
00:04:29,923 --> 00:04:31,966
Why are you following us?!

68
00:04:31,966 --> 00:04:35,819
Huh? Wait, You're that friend of Vera's!

69
00:04:35,819 --> 00:04:36,326
Now you recognize me?

70
00:04:36,326 --> 00:04:39,879
Great! Do you want to help me look for that robot?

71
00:04:39,879 --> 00:04:41,377
R-robot?

72
00:04:41,377 --> 00:04:43,807
The monster that the truck driver saw!

73
00:04:43,807 --> 00:04:45,990
Is there any evidence that it is a robot?

74
00:04:45,990 --> 00:04:53,334
You're right, there's no proof. I took pictures with my camera, but for some reason all the data has been wiped out.

75
00:04:53,334 --> 00:04:58,759
Thanks to that, I got scolded by the editor-in-chief, and Vera looked down on me.

76
00:04:59,872 --> 00:05:02,605
Have we been too hard on him?

77
00:05:02,605 --> 00:05:07,910
Just you wait, editor-in-chief! I'll take you down a peg or two for sure!!
Why is he like this?!

78
00:05:07,910 --> 00:05:10,850
I'll reveal the secret of that monster!!!

79
00:05:10,850 --> 00:05:16,588
A monster, huh? As I expected, the people here don't seem too friendly towards our species.

80
00:05:25,143 --> 00:05:27,593
BOO!!!

81
00:05:29,422 --> 00:05:32,391
Go away, or I'll eat you right up!

82
00:05:32,691 --> 00:05:35,425
Heeeeelp!!!

83
00:05:38,653 --> 00:05:42,266
Phew. Huh? Why aren't you guys running away?

84
00:05:42,266 --> 00:05:44,408
You're a Metal Cardbot, right?

85
00:05:44,408 --> 00:05:46,422
Huh? Wait! You know about us?!

86
00:05:46,422 --> 00:05:48,468
Yeah, we know.

87
00:05:48,468 --> 00:05:49,540
That voice...

88
00:05:51,663 --> 00:05:53,569
It's been a long time, Musclehyde.

89
00:05:53,569 --> 00:05:54,677
Cielo!!

90
00:05:55,521 --> 00:05:58,665
Put me down!
It's been so long!

91
00:05:58,665 --> 00:06:01,711
What's going on? Where is this place?

92
00:06:01,711 --> 00:06:05,612
Calm down. Meet my new friends first.

93
00:06:06,209 --> 00:06:10,276
This is reporter Musclehyde from Cardian's Post. Would you care for an interview?

94
00:06:10,276 --> 00:06:11,271
An interview?

95
00:06:11,271 --> 00:06:13,744
You haven't changed at all. His old reporter habits still come out.

96
00:06:13,744 --> 00:06:15,730
There's newspaper on planet Machina?

97
00:06:15,730 --> 00:06:18,807
Yes. But it is very different from the newspaper on Earth.

98
00:06:18,807 --> 00:06:21,656
That's Mukara's Metal Breath. 

99
00:06:21,656 --> 00:06:26,149
Why do you have it? And why is there a Star Guardian sealed insi-
Well, that's because...

100
00:06:26,149 --> 00:06:27,584
Where's Mukara?

101
00:06:27,584 --> 00:06:31,319
He's no longer with us. He passed away a long time ago.

102
00:06:31,319 --> 00:06:32,322
Passed a-- what?!

103
00:06:32,322 --> 00:06:35,692
While we were sleeping, 4,000 years in Earth time have passed.

104
00:06:35,692 --> 00:06:37,223
4,000 years?!

105
00:06:37,223 --> 00:06:40,524
We still don't know where Captain Gigantrex went, either.

106
00:06:40,524 --> 00:06:44,180
This can't be happening! It's worse than I thought!

107
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:48,612
Don't worry! I'll help you find all your scattered friends.

108
00:06:49,139 --> 00:06:51,413
Ah... Who are you?

109
00:06:51,413 --> 00:06:54,340
I'm Jun! Nice to meet ya!

110
00:06:54,340 --> 00:06:56,629
Jun...

111
00:06:57,168 --> 00:06:59,218
Don't fall for it, Musclehyde!

112
00:07:02,0 --> 00:07:03,278
Red Blitz!

113
00:07:03,278 --> 00:07:05,144
Red Blitz! You're okay too!

114
00:07:05,144 --> 00:07:07,197
Don't be fooled by that little brat! 

115
00:07:09,223 --> 00:07:13,362
He's trying to use Mukara's Metal Breath to rule over us!

116
00:07:13,362 --> 00:07:14,213
What?

117
00:07:14,213 --> 00:07:18,439
That's not true! Jun has no intention to do that! If you'd just listen to him, you'd know that!

118
00:07:18,439 --> 00:07:19,923
What's going on...?

119
00:07:19,923 --> 00:07:25,947
Cielo, you fell for that kid's lies?! If that's how it is, then you're my enemy too!

120
00:07:40,531 --> 00:07:42,340
Cut it out, Red Blitz!

121
00:07:47,456 --> 00:07:48,283
Cielo!!

122
00:07:48,596 --> 00:07:51,930
Jun! Cielo won't be able to stand up to Red Blitz like this!

123
00:07:53,149 --> 00:07:55,250
Metal Breath, pick up!

124
00:07:58,250 --> 00:08:00,250
Blue Cop S, Set up!

125
00:08:17,331 --> 00:08:19,692
Blue Cop! Star Rising Shot!

126
00:08:19,884 --> 00:08:22,790
Star Rising Shot!

127
00:08:26,831 --> 00:08:30,343
You think that'll work on me again?! Scarlet Typhoon!

128
00:08:30,343 --> 00:08:31,651
Block it, Blue Cop!

129
00:08:33,955 --> 00:08:34,663
Stay back!

130
00:08:34,663 --> 00:08:35,446
Be careful!

131
00:08:36,643 --> 00:08:39,557
I'll take that Metal Breath back today for sure!

132
00:08:39,855 --> 00:08:42,273
You're one to talk! Give me back my Metal Breath!

133
00:08:42,273 --> 00:08:44,475
I know you stole that one too!

134
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:46,211
Jun!

135
00:08:48,687 --> 00:08:49,379
Cielo!

136
00:08:49,379 --> 00:08:51,100
Don't butt in, Cielo!

137
00:08:51,716 --> 00:08:54,870
Sorry, Red Blitz. This is who I choose to stand beside.

138
00:08:54,870 --> 00:08:56,225
You...!!

139
00:08:56,225 --> 00:08:59,557
You need to try cooling your head!!

140
00:09:01,893 --> 00:09:02,918
Red Blitz!

141
00:09:06,745 --> 00:09:07,423
Jun!

142
00:09:07,423 --> 00:09:08,192
Alright!

143
00:09:09,423 --> 00:09:11,192
Cielo! Set up!

144
00:09:24,508 --> 00:09:26,158
Crimson Shoot!

145
00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:29,903
Skyjet Shot!

146
00:09:29,903 --> 00:09:31,442
Skyjet Shot!

147
00:09:34,850 --> 00:09:36,514
Musclehyde! Help me!

148
00:09:39,211 --> 00:09:40,528
Homing Magnum!

149
00:09:49,336 --> 00:09:51,254
Blue Cop! Star Rising Shot!

150
00:09:57,254 --> 00:09:58,615
Musclehyde!!

151
00:10:02,743 --> 00:10:04,149
Let's settle this now!

152
00:10:04,567 --> 00:10:08,697
Blue Cop! Meteor Bolt Punch!!

153
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:11,485
Meteor Bolt...!

154
00:10:15,456 --> 00:10:16,841
Punch!!

155
00:10:17,248 --> 00:10:17,884
What?!

156
00:10:25,855 --> 00:10:27,105
That form is...!

157
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:30,835
Such strength...

158
00:10:32,134 --> 00:10:41,937
Those I had interviewed gave me this title. The strongest reporter who can take anyone down... The Arms of Steel, Musclehyde!

159
00:10:41,937 --> 00:10:46,368
All those arms are holding down Blue Cop. One, two, three... Ah!

160
00:10:48,903 --> 00:10:49,480
Look out!

161
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:51,360
Blue Cop! Hurry and get out of there!

162
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:52,831
Bronto Strike!!!

163
00:11:04,298 --> 00:11:07,210
You still got that Herculean strength too, Musclehyde.

164
00:11:07,639 --> 00:11:13,254
What's the matter? Get over here so we can continue the interview!

165
00:11:14,663 --> 00:11:18,341
I met with Musclehyde today, so I'm done here. 

166
00:11:18,341 --> 00:11:20,590
Let's go, Musclehyde.

167
00:11:20,557 --> 00:11:22,778
Ah! Red Blitz! Wait up!

168
00:11:24,207 --> 00:11:25,879
Musclehyde! There's still more I need to say--

169
00:11:25,879 --> 00:11:28,764
Cielo. You don't have to go after them.

170
00:11:28,764 --> 00:11:29,278
What?

171
00:11:29,278 --> 00:11:32,647
I'm sure we'll see them again soon.

172
00:11:35,437 --> 00:11:36,263
Alright.
