1
00:00:01,806 --> 00:00:05,331
Menace Up in the Sky!

2
00:00:07,484 --> 00:00:12,400
The village of Porcaca kept watch over 4 treasures. 

3
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:14,445
The crimson flash, Red Blitz.

4
00:00:14,445 --> 00:00:17,600
The champion of the sky, Cielo.

5
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:20,838
The arms of steel, Musclehyde.

6
00:00:20,838 --> 00:00:24,292
And their leader, Gigantrex.

7
00:00:25,437 --> 00:00:28,471
There is also a tale that's been passed down for generations that says,

8
00:00:28,471 --> 00:00:31,407
"The giants must not be awakened until the time comes."

9
00:00:31,407 --> 00:00:32,241
The time?

10
00:00:32,241 --> 00:00:36,267
If I were them, my eyes would open right up to the smell of breakfast!

11
00:00:36,267 --> 00:00:41,460
Two have already woken up among the 4 stolen tablets. We need to find the remaining two quickly.

12
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:43,932
Do you know where the other two are?

13
00:00:43,932 --> 00:00:46,127
I'm afraid we don't have any clues yet.

14
00:00:46,127 --> 00:00:50,460
I'm also worried about where the other two, Red Blitz and Cielo, went off to.

15
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:53,792
One of them had a device that could teleport through space.

16
00:00:53,792 --> 00:00:54,734
Through space?

17
00:00:54,734 --> 00:00:58,256
Not anymore. It started to become a problem, so I broke it! 

18
00:01:03,533 --> 00:01:07,549
I bet they're wandering around aimlessly somewhere right now!

19
00:01:11,349 --> 00:01:13,468
What the-? It's so dark, I can't see anything!

20
00:01:14,269 --> 00:01:16,117
You're buried upside down.

21
00:01:21,283 --> 00:01:24,900
Huh? Where the heck are we now?!

22
00:01:26,256 --> 00:01:28,900
I'll look for the two remaining tablets.

23
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:29,769
Crest...

24
00:01:29,769 --> 00:01:33,908
It's my fault we're in this situation. I'll get them back no matter the cost.

25
00:01:33,908 --> 00:01:36,604
Okay. I'll be counting on you, Crest!

26
00:01:39,403 --> 00:01:41,673
My, leaving so soon?

27
00:01:41,673 --> 00:01:46,234
Ah... Yes! I-I'll make sure to stay to eat next time.

28
00:01:46,234 --> 00:01:47,545
Then I'll be leaving too-

29
00:01:47,545 --> 00:01:53,742
You can't. My burger joint has a rule that any new friend Jun brings in has to eat all 10 burgers before they leave.

30
00:01:53,742 --> 00:01:55,639
T-Ten burgers?!

31
00:01:55,639 --> 00:01:57,742
Go ahead, have some.

32
00:01:57,742 --> 00:02:00,200
You guys had to do this too?!

33
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:03,394
Yeah... I didn't eat another hamburger for two months after I did that.

34
00:02:03,394 --> 00:02:04,501
Three months here...

35
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:08,110
Thank you for the meal!

36
00:02:10,644 --> 00:02:11,783
Delicious!

37
00:02:12,223 --> 00:02:16,887
I'm glad you like them. By the way, where are you staying the night?

38
00:02:17,992 --> 00:02:19,199
I'll have to look for someplace now.

39
00:02:19,199 --> 00:02:21,131
What? Now?

40
00:02:21,131 --> 00:02:24,926
It's okay, Ma'am! I can sleep well anywhere.

41
00:02:24,926 --> 00:02:26,354
That won't do!

42
00:02:32,631 --> 00:02:34,853
Here, you can stay in this room.

43
00:02:34,853 --> 00:02:36,783
Is it really okay?

44
00:02:37,182 --> 00:02:40,711
Of course it's not okay! That's my room!

45
00:02:40,711 --> 00:02:43,396
You'll just have to sleep with Bluey for the time being.

46
00:02:43,396 --> 00:02:45,545
Bluey...? WHAT?!

47
00:02:48,228 --> 00:02:52,227
Brrr... it's cold. Why does my neighborhood have to be so much colder at night?

48
00:02:52,227 --> 00:02:53,581
Should I turn on the heater?

49
00:02:53,581 --> 00:02:55,692
Nah, it's fine.

50
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:01,122
Come to think of it... it's too quiet.

51
00:03:01,122 --> 00:03:03,555
Turn on the radio, then.

52
00:03:03,555 --> 00:03:08,729
Until yesterday it was so noisy here. Every day was so loud that I wanted to cover my ears...

53
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:12,555
...and that is how I became the greatest pirate in the universe!

54
00:03:14,512 --> 00:03:15,400
Is that true?

55
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:16,99
No.

56
00:03:16,99 --> 00:03:17,980
He is indeed the greatest charlatan in the universe.

57
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:20,548
What?! Does this weird-eyed guy have something to say about me?

58
00:03:21,548 --> 00:03:23,203
Will they ever get tired of fighting?

59
00:03:23,203 --> 00:03:24,415
That's proof of their friendship.

60
00:03:24,415 --> 00:03:27,465
Why don't you compete with dancing? I'll be the judge!

61
00:03:27,465 --> 00:03:30,131
Stop it! You promised that you'd cause no trouble when Jun is at school-!

62
00:03:32,413 --> 00:03:34,355
I've never seen Blue bro's bare head before!

63
00:03:34,355 --> 00:03:35,959
It's my first time seeing it too.

64
00:03:37,737 --> 00:03:40,852
...But now, I'm all alone again.

65
00:03:41,629 --> 00:03:44,300
I'm here with you, Blue Cop.
Jun!

66
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:50,637
I'll make sure to get our Metal Breath back from Red Blitz, and everyone along with it. They're all my dearest friends, after all!

67
00:03:50,637 --> 00:03:52,675
Yes. Let's try our best!

68
00:03:53,290 --> 00:03:57,335
What? 4,000 years?! You mean we've been sleeping that long?!

69
00:03:57,335 --> 00:04:01,455
Well we needed to wait until the time came, but we've been asleep for too long.

70
00:04:03,139 --> 00:04:05,782
Useless! It's completely busted!

71
00:04:05,782 --> 00:04:07,397
Then what about the Speranza?

72
00:04:07,397 --> 00:04:13,456
We can't go back there, I guess. The worst part is that we can't even find where Musclehyde and Captain Gigantrex went!

73
00:04:13,456 --> 00:04:17,245
It's all because of that Jun kid, who was with the Star Guardian!

74
00:04:17,245 --> 00:04:20,487
Jun? That boy who had the Metal Breath?

75
00:04:20,487 --> 00:04:24,415
Yeah. That Metal Breath of his probably belongs to Mukara.

76
00:04:24,415 --> 00:04:26,790
Wh- what?!

77
00:04:27,148 --> 00:04:28,177
Huh?

78
00:04:28,177 --> 00:04:30,182
Okay, now it's official!

79
00:04:30,182 --> 00:04:33,288
Official? What do you mean? 

80
00:04:34,365 --> 00:04:35,865
Cielo! Hey!! 

81
00:04:36,466 --> 00:04:38,449
What do you mean?!

82
00:04:40,415 --> 00:04:45,922
That kid must've taken Mukara's Metal Breath while we were sleeping. 

83
00:04:45,922 --> 00:04:47,963
There'll be no mercy for him!

84
00:04:50,427 --> 00:04:55,100
Jun? Jun! Jun! Wake up! Someone is here!

85
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:56,612
Ehh... Five more minutes...

86
00:04:56,612 --> 00:04:58,963
Wake up already, sleepy head!

87
00:04:58,963 --> 00:05:01,151
Uwaaagh!! Vera!

88
00:05:01,151 --> 00:05:04,338
Why are you freaking out like that? And what's with the police car?

89
00:05:04,338 --> 00:05:10,956
Someone my dad knows left it here for a while. Why are you here so early in the morning anyway?

90
00:05:10,956 --> 00:05:12,293
We're here to collect news material.

91
00:05:12,293 --> 00:05:17,430
Hello! Nice to meet you. I'm Jim Hawkins from the Mowtown Times.

92
00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:20,819
Mowtown Times?

93
00:05:20,819 --> 00:05:23,899
Mr. Jim is a photojournalist who works for my dad's newspaper.

94
00:05:23,899 --> 00:05:25,353
A photojournalist?!

95
00:05:25,353 --> 00:05:29,569
I saw you out on the street yesterday. You know this robot, right?

96
00:05:29,569 --> 00:05:31,651
W-well, it's uh...

97
00:05:31,651 --> 00:05:38,509
Relax. It's not like you're being interrogated by the police or anything. All you need to do is be honest about this robot.

98
00:05:38,509 --> 00:05:42,737
Ehh... W-well, uhh...

99
00:05:42,737 --> 00:05:43,529
- Peruru!
- It... looks like a robot, but at the same time it doesn't! Heheh...

100
00:05:43,529 --> 00:05:47,529
- According to the tales in my village, it is said that the pottery was shattered when the giants sang. Can you do that?
- It... looks like a robot, but at the same time it doesn't! Heheh...

101
00:05:47,529 --> 00:05:48,810
- According to the tales in my village, it is said that the pottery was shattered when the giants sang. Can you do that?
- But... I don't really know... uh...

102
00:05:48,810 --> 00:05:50,612
- Yes. I will try.
- But... I don't really know... uh...

103
00:05:50,612 --> 00:05:52,154
Well? Speak up.

104
00:05:52,154 --> 00:05:55,213
W-well... Ow!!

105
00:05:57,338 --> 00:05:58,999
My- My camera!

106
00:05:58,999 --> 00:05:59,872
There's no way!

107
00:05:59,872 --> 00:06:02,262
All the data is gone!

108
00:06:02,918 --> 00:06:04,401
What is that?

109
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:10,536
It's Cielo!

110
00:06:10,843 --> 00:06:13,149
It's headed to the main street in Mowtown!

111
00:06:13,149 --> 00:06:15,509
What is that airplane? Mr. Jim, come quick!

112
00:06:15,509 --> 00:06:17,653
Huh? W-wait up!

113
00:06:18,350 --> 00:06:19,773
Let's go too!
Alright!

114
00:06:19,773 --> 00:06:23,312
Hold on a minute. You're not going out like that, are you? 

115
00:06:23,312 --> 00:06:25,951
Here. Your mom prepared it for you.

116
00:06:32,129 --> 00:06:33,228
Let's go!

117
00:06:39,668 --> 00:06:41,584
What's that?
Cool!

118
00:06:42,439 --> 00:06:48,548
Show yourself, boy! The Metal Breath you're wearing belongs to Mukara! Give it back, or else!

119
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:52,798
Oh man. They're making quite a scene.

120
00:06:52,798 --> 00:06:55,451
We'll be in bigger trouble if we don't seal them now.

121
00:06:55,451 --> 00:06:56,358
Seal?

122
00:06:56,358 --> 00:06:59,408
That means putting Metal Cardbots back into cards.

123
00:06:59,408 --> 00:07:01,110
Do you know how to do it?

124
00:07:01,557 --> 00:07:02,632
I think so.

125
00:07:02,632 --> 00:07:05,937
Jun has sealed 12 Cardbots so far, myself included.

126
00:07:07,555 --> 00:07:08,899
Then let me help!

127
00:07:08,899 --> 00:07:10,858
Huh? How?

128
00:07:10,858 --> 00:07:18,132
I'm a caretaker of the ruins in my village. It is my duty as a descendant of Mukara to protect the souls of the giants that once slept there.

129
00:07:18,132 --> 00:07:19,468
That spear...

130
00:07:25,298 --> 00:07:27,286
Okay. I'll be counting on you.

131
00:07:27,286 --> 00:07:31,971
But our opponent can fly freely through the sky. It won't be easy to land a hit with that spear.

132
00:07:31,971 --> 00:07:35,588
Don't worry. I have a great idea.

133
00:07:36,850 --> 00:07:42,836
- I don't know how you obtained that Metal Breath, but it's not yours!
- Dang it, you're so impatient. There's no way that kid will just show up even if you go on a full on rampage like that!

134
00:07:43,435 --> 00:07:47,288
How long are you going to hide? Show yourself, blue-haired boy!

135
00:07:47,288 --> 00:07:48,512
I'm over here!

136
00:07:51,187 --> 00:07:52,959
If you want this, then-

137
00:07:54,731 --> 00:07:56,600
What's wrong with you?!

138
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:58,338
Firing from up there is cowardly!

139
00:07:58,338 --> 00:08:01,490
Surrender now, or the next one won't miss!

140
00:08:01,490 --> 00:08:03,516
Blue Cop, let's do as we planned!

141
00:08:04,110 --> 00:08:05,764
Skyjet Shot!

142
00:08:10,305 --> 00:08:11,531
Not a chance!

143
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:20,875
They know our position!

144
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:22,141
Let's go with plan B, then!

145
00:08:22,141 --> 00:08:23,199
Roger that!

146
00:08:36,230 --> 00:08:38,149
The parking building!

147
00:08:38,149 --> 00:08:39,682
Quick! Take pictures! The pictures!

148
00:08:39,782 --> 00:08:41,394
Now's not the time for that-!

149
00:08:43,774 --> 00:08:44,566
Where are you?

150
00:08:48,529 --> 00:08:49,679
Got you!

151
00:08:54,532 --> 00:08:57,584
You think you can run away from me?

152
00:08:57,584 --> 00:08:59,315
Well then, how about this?

153
00:09:03,846 --> 00:09:04,855
Oh no!

154
00:09:07,649 --> 00:09:08,513
You've got some nerve!

155
00:09:08,712 --> 00:09:10,980
Always make sure to watch where you're going.

156
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:25,120
Hmph! You think I can't keep up through these shallow passages?

157
00:09:27,508 --> 00:09:28,331
What the?

158
00:09:28,812 --> 00:09:30,485
Homing Magnum!

159
00:09:32,427 --> 00:09:34,369
Missiles are following us, Blue Cop!

160
00:09:34,469 --> 00:09:35,653
Hang on tight, Jun!

161
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:40,525
That nimble rat!

162
00:09:48,216 --> 00:09:49,368
They're here.

163
00:09:54,317 --> 00:09:55,865
Peruru! Now!

164
00:10:14,379 --> 00:10:15,341
This can't be happening!

165
00:10:15,341 --> 00:10:17,384
Let's finish this! Blue Cop!

166
00:10:17,384 --> 00:10:17,971
Yes!

167
00:10:18,359 --> 00:10:22,782
Blue Cop! Meteor Bolt Punch!

168
00:10:23,509 --> 00:10:27,990
Meteor Bolt Punch!

169
00:10:30,548 --> 00:10:32,235
Skyjet Shot!

170
00:10:38,682 --> 00:10:40,936
Mukara... Where are you...?!

171
00:10:48,832 --> 00:10:49,932
It worked!

172
00:10:51,548 --> 00:10:53,907
Metal Cardbot, Change up!

173
00:11:08,259 --> 00:11:10,594
Cielo, Sealed!

174
00:11:14,105 --> 00:11:15,389
You did it, Jun.

175
00:11:15,389 --> 00:11:18,865
Of course we did! Thanks to Blue Cop and you. 

176
00:11:18,865 --> 00:11:20,263
So this is how they turn into cards.

177
00:11:20,263 --> 00:11:24,346
Dang you, Cielo. You're so impatient.

178
00:11:24,346 --> 00:11:28,543
I have to find Musclehyde and Captain Gigantrex as soon as possible!
