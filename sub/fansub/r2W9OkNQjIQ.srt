1
00:00:02,177 --> 00:00:04,341
Midnight Ghost Train

2
00:00:05,254 --> 00:00:09,730
A sleepover? You mean you'll all study together? At Edo's car center?

3
00:00:09,730 --> 00:00:13,269
Yeah! Theo and Anna will be there too, so it'll be fine.

4
00:00:13,269 --> 00:00:14,416
I'm also coming along.

5
00:00:14,416 --> 00:00:16,580
But you're already getting good grades, Peruru.

6
00:00:16,580 --> 00:00:19,745
Besides, you don't even go to school here, and yet you want to study too?

7
00:00:19,745 --> 00:00:23,652
You flatter me, ma'am! I still have a lot to learn. 

8
00:00:23,652 --> 00:00:30,213
Besides, my mother called me recently and asked, "Are you studying enough?" So I still have to study hard!

9
00:00:31,419 --> 00:00:33,332
Okay, I understand.

10
00:00:33,332 --> 00:00:36,689
I'll call Edo for the details, so stay out of trouble.

11
00:00:36,689 --> 00:00:38,646
Blue Cop, please watch after them.

12
00:00:38,646 --> 00:00:40,243
Of course, ma'am. You can count on me.

13
00:00:40,243 --> 00:00:42,210
I deceived her... I actually lied to her...

14
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:44,274
- Don't be like that, Blue Cop!
- How could I let this happen?

15
00:00:44,274 --> 00:00:46,338
- In this world, there is such a thing as a necessary lie.
- I've never lied to anybody in my life, except-

16
00:00:46,338 --> 00:00:49,609
You got me into trouble too! How am I supposed to explain this to Yuri if we get caught?!

17
00:00:49,609 --> 00:00:51,871
Ah, just make up a good story!

18
00:00:51,871 --> 00:00:54,982
Ahem! "Midnight Express".

19
00:00:54,982 --> 00:01:00,293
That's the name of a jet-black express train that appears out of thin air on the Mowtown Railroad, late at night.

20
00:01:06,653 --> 00:01:13,292
No one knows where it's headed, so there's rumors that if you get on, you'll be taken straight to hell.

21
00:01:13,292 --> 00:01:15,730
But! If my instincts are correct, that train must be a Metal Cardbot-

22
00:01:15,730 --> 00:01:17,935
Jun. Who are you talking to?

23
00:01:17,935 --> 00:01:20,504
Good thing Rock Crush is at the car center, 'cause that story would freak him out.

24
00:01:20,504 --> 00:01:22,543
I'm sure Musclehyde will take good care of him for us.

25
00:01:22,543 --> 00:01:24,417
Yeah. They said they were going to watch cartoons together.

26
00:01:24,417 --> 00:01:26,271
Shh! It's here!

27
00:01:36,561 --> 00:01:38,731
The Midnight Express! 

28
00:01:38,731 --> 00:01:42,99
I've never seen a train that looks like this! Who knows what makes this train run?

29
00:01:42,99 --> 00:01:43,141
What is he babbling about?

30
00:01:43,141 --> 00:01:45,573
Theo really loves trains.

31
00:01:49,832 --> 00:01:50,532
Let's go!

32
00:01:50,831 --> 00:01:53,466
Guys, are you sure this is safe? If we get on this train-!

33
00:01:56,368 --> 00:01:57,884
What the- is that you, Jun?

34
00:01:57,884 --> 00:01:59,50
Vance? Lavi?!

35
00:01:59,50 --> 00:02:02,181
Huh? Wait, don't tell me. You're here to reveal the secret of this train as well-

36
00:02:02,181 --> 00:02:03,413
P-Peruru!

37
00:02:03,912 --> 00:02:05,533
Why is she with Jun?

38
00:02:05,533 --> 00:02:07,662
Hey, what's your relationship with this punk?

39
00:02:07,662 --> 00:02:09,403
Punk? He has a name, you know.

40
00:02:09,403 --> 00:02:10,824
Huh? Is that...

41
00:02:12,109 --> 00:02:13,276
Ms. Mona?!

42
00:02:13,276 --> 00:02:17,635
Ms. Mona? I can't just sit here like this! Ms. Monaaaa!!

43
00:02:18,409 --> 00:02:20,138
Wait, Uncle Edo!

44
00:02:20,588 --> 00:02:21,453
Let's go!

45
00:02:21,453 --> 00:02:22,228
Yeah!

46
00:02:26,0 --> 00:02:26,961
Ms. Mona!

47
00:02:26,961 --> 00:02:28,319
My, Mr. Edo!

48
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:31,151
You shouldn't be here. It's dangerou- agh!

49
00:02:32,704 --> 00:02:35,711
I thought I missed the last train. Thank goodness.

50
00:02:35,711 --> 00:02:38,600
What are you talking about? This isn't the last train.

51
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:39,0
What?

52
00:02:39,0 --> 00:02:40,432
Don't butt in!

53
00:02:40,432 --> 00:02:43,448
This train won't stop at Oatland station?

54
00:02:44,371 --> 00:02:46,781
Why are you going to Oatland station at midnight?

55
00:02:46,781 --> 00:02:49,722
It's because my Mao is in critical condition.

56
00:02:49,722 --> 00:02:50,789
Wait, what?!

57
00:02:50,789 --> 00:02:55,706
He's a spirited boy who loves to run around. He's been with me since he was a baby... 

58
00:02:55,706 --> 00:02:58,10
and now he's waiting for me to be there.

59
00:02:58,10 --> 00:02:59,155
Oh no...

60
00:03:01,575 --> 00:03:02,897
Wh-wh-what was that?

61
00:03:02,897 --> 00:03:04,729
Was it a ghost?

62
00:03:04,729 --> 00:03:06,872
Th-th-that's unscientific!

63
00:03:07,611 --> 00:03:08,997
Let me have a look!

64
00:03:10,295 --> 00:03:11,592
I'll go with you!

65
00:03:13,823 --> 00:03:14,471
Unce Ed-

66
00:03:15,598 --> 00:03:16,515
I-I-I'll open it.

67
00:03:19,127 --> 00:03:21,542
- AAAAAAAAAHHHHHH!!!
- IT'S A GHOOOOOOOOST!!!

68
00:03:21,542 --> 00:03:22,520
Jun?

69
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:25,379
Wait, that voice... Vera! Are you here to-

70
00:03:25,379 --> 00:03:28,727
Solve the mystery of the Midnight Express, of course!

71
00:03:28,727 --> 00:03:31,140
This time I'm gonna get the scoop!

72
00:03:32,218 --> 00:03:35,236
So you were the ones who have been making all that noise.

73
00:03:35,236 --> 00:03:37,103
Who is it this time?

74
00:03:37,103 --> 00:03:38,201
Mr. Conductor...

75
00:03:39,651 --> 00:03:40,428
A robot?!

76
00:03:41,20 --> 00:03:43,347
Please, be quiet on the train.

77
00:03:43,347 --> 00:03:45,427
A Sc-scoop...

78
00:03:45,427 --> 00:03:47,420
Please adhere to passenger etiquette.

79
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:48,703
Aah! Hot!!

80
00:03:49,307 --> 00:03:50,377
Jun! It's dangerous!

81
00:03:50,377 --> 00:03:51,768
Who the heck was that?

82
00:03:51,768 --> 00:03:53,170
Let's get out of here!

83
00:03:55,897 --> 00:03:57,131
M-Ms. Mona?!

84
00:03:57,536 --> 00:04:00,412
Mr. Conductor! Could you please take me to Oatland station?

85
00:04:00,412 --> 00:04:02,270
Oatland station, you say...?

86
00:04:02,270 --> 00:04:03,323
I'm begging you!

87
00:04:03,323 --> 00:04:05,115
Y-y-yeah! Pretty please!

88
00:04:05,115 --> 00:04:10,907
Her precious family member Mao is very sick right now! He's waiting for her!

89
00:04:11,856 --> 00:04:13,324
How unfortunate...

90
00:04:16,396 --> 00:04:20,973
Leave it to me. I'll make sure you get to Oatland station.

91
00:04:20,973 --> 00:04:23,79
Thank you so much!!

92
00:04:23,79 --> 00:04:25,930
Now I'll check everyone else's tickets.

93
00:04:25,930 --> 00:04:26,293
Tickets?

94
00:04:26,293 --> 00:04:28,600
A-ah, did we need tickets?

95
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:29,475
We don't have them!

96
00:04:29,475 --> 00:04:32,207
Ah, so you all rode for free?

97
00:04:32,207 --> 00:04:34,271
Please get off the train immediately.

98
00:04:34,271 --> 00:04:35,992
Jun, guys, retreat!

99
00:04:38,343 --> 00:04:43,221
Fare evasion is an unforgivable offense. (FX-glitch)

100
00:04:44,838 --> 00:04:45,920
What the heck is with that robot?!

101
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:47,884
I can tell something's wrong just by looking at it!

102
00:04:47,884 --> 00:04:50,966
It is useless to resist, fare dodgers, so please stop resisting. (FX-glitch)

103
00:04:50,966 --> 00:04:51,649
Peruru!

104
00:04:52,350 --> 00:04:55,377
Jun... Your idea better work...

105
00:04:56,281 --> 00:04:59,39
Disconnecting the passenger cars from the locomotive! Great idea!

106
00:04:59,39 --> 00:05:02,555
Vance and Vera are here, so we should be careful about what we say.

107
00:05:02,555 --> 00:05:04,949
We can't let them know about the Metal Cardbots, right?

108
00:05:05,999 --> 00:05:09,103
This is why I didn't wanna come with you guys- Huh?

109
00:05:09,103 --> 00:05:13,903
Do not think you can hold out... forever!

110
00:05:13,903 --> 00:05:16,564
Riding for free is strictly prohibited.

111
00:05:17,552 --> 00:05:19,969
Hm? I don't see the other two-

112
00:05:28,456 --> 00:05:29,144
Here!

113
00:05:29,874 --> 00:05:32,500
You came in through the roof of the train. May I ask what you are doing here?

114
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:36,319
M-Mr. Conductor! I-I just wanted to get some fresh air...

115
00:05:40,158 --> 00:05:41,468
Please step aside!

116
00:05:43,582 --> 00:05:44,744
Keep up the hard work!~

117
00:05:44,744 --> 00:05:46,172
What are you doing?!

118
00:05:51,781 --> 00:05:52,651
What the-?!

119
00:05:56,735 --> 00:05:59,875
WAAAAAAAH!!!

120
00:05:59,875 --> 00:06:00,814
Blue Cop!!

121
00:06:15,562 --> 00:06:17,382
Jun, are you hurt?

122
00:06:17,382 --> 00:06:19,391
I'm fine... thanks, Blue Cop.

123
00:06:19,391 --> 00:06:23,588
An emergency stop without a good reason... is prohibited.

124
00:06:23,588 --> 00:06:25,979
I knew it. You're a Metal Cardbot.

125
00:06:25,979 --> 00:06:28,686
I go by the name of Blastrain.

126
00:06:30,675 --> 00:06:34,452
Blastrain! I have something to ask you. Are you a Hidden Cardbot?

127
00:06:34,452 --> 00:06:36,999
Hidden Cardbot? What do you mean?

128
00:06:36,999 --> 00:06:38,317
Wait, he doesn't know anything?

129
00:06:38,317 --> 00:06:39,719
I know some things.

130
00:06:39,719 --> 00:06:42,122
One of them is that you are my enemy!

131
00:06:43,999 --> 00:06:45,283
Wait!

132
00:06:45,283 --> 00:06:47,230
He looks sick.

133
00:06:47,230 --> 00:06:48,447
Sick?

134
00:06:48,447 --> 00:06:52,29
Deep Bite is right. He's got symptoms similar to that of Captain Gigantrex.

135
00:06:52,29 --> 00:06:53,997
But he doesn't seem to be injured anywhere...

136
00:06:55,738 --> 00:07:00,732
Oi. Easy now, Mr. Conductor. I've been watching you and it looks like you've lost your true self.

137
00:07:00,732 --> 00:07:02,148
Excuse me? What are you-

138
00:07:02,749 --> 00:07:08,487
Your mental state is like a runaway train right now. You remind me of my past self... I can't just stand by and watch.

139
00:07:09,134 --> 00:07:11,391
I'm... I'm fine!

140
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:19,312
Hey, put that dangerous thing down. We have a competent friend named Edo. He can fix you right up, so come with u-

141
00:07:24,615 --> 00:07:26,838
I knew my words wouldn't work on him!

142
00:07:26,838 --> 00:07:28,593
Deep Bite is angry...

143
00:07:28,593 --> 00:07:31,511
Jun. I guess we'll have to convince him by force!

144
00:07:32,99 --> 00:07:32,957
Looks like we have no choice.

145
00:07:33,428 --> 00:07:34,999
Metal Breath! Pick up!

146
00:07:37,516 --> 00:07:39,292
Deep Bite! Set up!

147
00:07:53,735 --> 00:07:56,279
Deep Bite! Beam Trident Gatling!

148
00:08:02,562 --> 00:08:04,283
Go for his gun, Deep Bite!

149
00:08:04,283 --> 00:08:06,814
Trident! Cannon!!

150
00:08:08,754 --> 00:08:10,596
Great job! Now grab hold of him!

151
00:08:13,339 --> 00:08:14,979
I didn't ask you to bite him...

152
00:08:17,9 --> 00:08:20,295
Just let me run on the railroad tracks!

153
00:08:21,929 --> 00:08:26,483
Blastrain! Why are you so obsessed with running on a railroad track when you have no passengers on board?!

154
00:08:26,483 --> 00:08:29,432
Because I have never seen railroad tracks before coming to Earth.

155
00:08:29,432 --> 00:08:30,697
There were no railroad tracks on planet Machina?

156
00:08:30,697 --> 00:08:32,83
No, there weren't.

157
00:08:32,83 --> 00:08:36,776
On Planet Machina, I had to create a rail of light myself to in order to move.

158
00:08:36,776 --> 00:08:42,668
So if I took my eyes off of the road or thought about something else for even one second, I'd have a big accident.

159
00:08:42,969 --> 00:08:44,229
But on this planet...

160
00:08:47,173 --> 00:08:51,871
I could just keep running on the rails.

161
00:08:51,871 --> 00:08:56,169
To be able to run without thinking... Can you imagine how wonderful that is?

162
00:08:56,169 --> 00:09:00,873
That's one reason why I only run in the middle of the night, so as not to inconvenience humans!

163
00:09:01,243 --> 00:09:02,238
That's why...

164
00:09:02,238 --> 00:09:07,967
So I'm asking for your cooperation... In getting me back on the rails!

165
00:09:09,951 --> 00:09:11,336
Reconnection sequence!

166
00:09:15,693 --> 00:09:17,855
My camera...

167
00:09:17,855 --> 00:09:19,524
Gosh, stop crying!

168
00:09:19,524 --> 00:09:22,217
I still have 20 monthly installments to pay it off!

169
00:09:22,217 --> 00:09:24,195
I heard the sound of a horn over there.

170
00:09:24,195 --> 00:09:26,159
Just use the company camera!

171
00:09:26,159 --> 00:09:29,163
But the company cameras are old and outdated!

172
00:09:29,163 --> 00:09:31,131
Huh?! The passenger cars are moving on their own!

173
00:09:32,705 --> 00:09:36,302
Where are you going without us?! Mr. Jim, Let's chase that train!

174
00:09:38,485 --> 00:09:39,691
Let's go, Ms. Mona.

175
00:09:41,326 --> 00:09:42,879
