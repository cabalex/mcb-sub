1
00:00:00,448 --> 00:00:02,944
Runaway Locomotive Blastrain

2
00:00:05,953 --> 00:00:07,820
Wh-why did you only take me?

3
00:00:07,820 --> 00:00:12,787
Because I made a promise. I promised to take you to Oatland station.

4
00:00:12,787 --> 00:00:13,564
What?

5
00:00:16,679 --> 00:00:18,609
Mr. Conductor...?

6
00:00:18,609 --> 00:00:19,204
Are you okay, ma'am?

7
00:00:19,204 --> 00:00:19,890
You're...

8
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:23,246
I'm Peruru! I came to rescue you, but...

9
00:00:26,518 --> 00:00:28,748
The train suddenly got faster!

10
00:00:31,089 --> 00:00:34,412
Midnight Express... Was a robot!

11
00:00:34,412 --> 00:00:36,582
And there were other robots too!

12
00:00:36,582 --> 00:00:38,551
I took pictures but none of them are clear!

13
00:00:38,551 --> 00:00:40,686
My camera!!

14
00:00:40,686 --> 00:00:44,319
Now, now. Calm down, everyone. Calm down.

15
00:00:44,319 --> 00:00:46,994
You know something! Tell me everything you know right now!

16
00:00:46,994 --> 00:00:48,810
Why can't you tell me what that was?!

17
00:00:48,810 --> 00:00:51,600
I don't know anything either...

18
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:54,682
Are we sure we can just leave them there?

19
00:00:54,682 --> 00:00:57,972
We can't take them with us. Anna said to count on her.

20
00:00:57,972 --> 00:01:01,609
We called their parents, so they'll take care of them.

21
00:01:01,609 --> 00:01:04,439
Jun! Blastrain is starting to speed up!

22
00:01:05,533 --> 00:01:07,897
He might get derailed if he keeps on running like that!

23
00:01:07,897 --> 00:01:12,412
Derailed?! Then what will happen to Ms. Mona?!

24
00:01:12,412 --> 00:01:14,230
Peruru is with her too, you know.

25
00:01:14,230 --> 00:01:15,718
AND PERURU!!

26
00:01:15,718 --> 00:01:19,169
Cielo, I need to speak with Blastrain! Can you get close to him?

27
00:01:19,169 --> 00:01:19,816
No problem!

28
00:01:21,307 --> 00:01:25,581
Blastrain! Slow down! It's dangerous to continue at this speed!

29
00:01:27,786 --> 00:01:28,509
Drat!

30
00:01:28,908 --> 00:01:31,439
It's rude to ignore someone when they're speaking to you!

31
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:32,439
Jun!

32
00:01:32,439 --> 00:01:33,662
Blue Cop? How are you holding up?

33
00:01:33,662 --> 00:01:35,853
I'm feeling better now that I'm in the Metal Breath.

34
00:01:35,853 --> 00:01:38,846
But, I think it's obvious that something is wrong with Blastrain.

35
00:01:38,846 --> 00:01:40,424
As expected...

36
00:01:40,424 --> 00:01:42,704
I kept thinking about what Blastrain said.

37
00:01:43,174 --> 00:01:45,454
I had never seen railroad tracks before coming to Earth.

38
00:01:45,454 --> 00:01:49,615
On this planet, I could just keep running on the rails.

39
00:01:49,615 --> 00:01:54,371
Ah! Mowtown's railroad is a third rail system that draws power from the tracks! 

40
00:01:54,371 --> 00:01:59,772
It's likely that the residual electricity was flowing into him and is causing him to malfunction!

41
00:01:59,772 --> 00:02:01,588
So that's why he lost consciousness...

42
00:02:01,588 --> 00:02:03,251
He ate something that's bad for him...

43
00:02:03,251 --> 00:02:06,379
So all we have to do is help him regain his consciousness, then?

44
00:02:06,379 --> 00:02:07,590
You can do that?

45
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:11,171
Did you forget how many Metal Cardbots I've fixed?!

46
00:02:11,171 --> 00:02:15,354
But to do that, I have to get on a train running at a terrifying speed...

47
00:02:15,354 --> 00:02:18,364
Don't you wanna... save Ms. Mona?!

48
00:02:18,364 --> 00:02:20,450
I'LL SAVE HER FOR SURE, JUN!!!

49
00:02:20,450 --> 00:02:21,937
FULL SPEED AHEAD!!!

50
00:02:21,937 --> 00:02:23,134
You're the best, big bro Edo!

51
00:02:23,134 --> 00:02:26,195
Alright! Let's do this!

52
00:02:28,562 --> 00:02:30,643
Ms. Monaaaaaa!!

53
00:02:30,643 --> 00:02:32,438
Uncle Edo! Are you sure about thi-

54
00:02:32,438 --> 00:02:35,158
I'm coming for you! Sit tight!

55
00:02:36,676 --> 00:02:38,984
Mr. Edo! Be careful!

56
00:02:39,894 --> 00:02:43,941
Leave it all to this genius mechanic! Let's go, Red Blitz!

57
00:02:43,941 --> 00:02:45,250
You got it!

58
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:47,634
I'll be coming for you!!

59
00:02:47,876 --> 00:02:50,825
Alright. Slowly now, keep on like this and-

60
00:02:50,825 --> 00:02:52,879
AAAHHHH!!

61
00:02:53,150 --> 00:02:53,718
Uncle!!

62
00:02:53,718 --> 00:02:54,473
Mr. Edo!!

63
00:02:54,473 --> 00:02:56,604
I'm okay!

64
00:02:56,604 --> 00:02:57,199
AGAIN.

65
00:02:57,199 --> 00:02:58,338
Huh? O-okay...

66
00:02:58,338 --> 00:02:59,966
The power of love is scary...

67
00:03:02,737 --> 00:03:03,463
Just wait and I'll-

68
00:03:03,463 --> 00:03:05,701
WOOOAAAHHH!!

69
00:03:06,201 --> 00:03:07,907
Mr. Edo!

70
00:03:15,493 --> 00:03:16,581
I got him!

71
00:03:17,152 --> 00:03:18,212
Thank goodness.

72
00:03:18,212 --> 00:03:20,430
Thank goodness for what?! Onto the next plan!

73
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:21,384
What?

74
00:03:21,384 --> 00:03:22,834
MS. MONAAAA!!

75
00:03:22,834 --> 00:03:23,706
Ma'am!

76
00:03:25,918 --> 00:03:27,548
Watch out for the cold!

77
00:03:27,784 --> 00:03:29,639
Mr. Edo! It's dangerous!

78
00:03:29,639 --> 00:03:31,521
Jun. Don't imitate him.

79
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:34,426
Okay! A little closer!

80
00:03:36,545 --> 00:03:39,466
I got it! Alright, stay close, Cielo!

81
00:03:39,466 --> 00:03:42,481
Hurry up, uncle! Tunnel up ahead!

82
00:03:44,704 --> 00:03:46,609
A-a-almost got it!

83
00:03:46,609 --> 00:03:48,110
It's not gonna work! Hang on tight!

84
00:03:48,110 --> 00:03:49,348
W-w-wait-

85
00:03:49,348 --> 00:03:52,769
AAAHHHHHHHH!!

86
00:03:52,968 --> 00:03:54,485
Another failure...

87
00:03:54,485 --> 00:03:56,201
Oh! The sun is rising!

88
00:03:59,653 --> 00:04:02,700
Jun, the first train from Oatland Station is about to depart.

89
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:06,110
The track Blastrain is traveling on is a single track, and if it continues like this,

90
00:04:06,110 --> 00:04:08,661
it will collide head-on with the train from the opposite direction!

91
00:04:08,661 --> 00:04:10,343
THEN WHAT ABOUT MS. MONA?!

92
00:04:10,343 --> 00:04:11,584
And Peruru!

93
00:04:11,584 --> 00:04:14,937
- We don't have time to get Uncle Edo onto Blastrain!
- DO SOMETHING!! MS. MONA!!! AAAAAAARGH!!!

94
00:04:15,215 --> 00:04:15,936
I'll do it!

95
00:04:15,936 --> 00:04:18,317
Huh? You? But how?

96
00:04:18,317 --> 00:04:23,978
Of course, I don't know anything about machines. But we have a genius mechanic on our side!

97
00:04:24,106 --> 00:04:26,129
Yes! I'm here!!

98
00:04:28,762 --> 00:04:30,312
Uncle, we're in the control room.

99
00:04:30,312 --> 00:04:33,430
Alright, take good care of Ms. Mona, Peruru!

100
00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:36,108
I'd appreciate if you worried about me too...

101
00:04:36,108 --> 00:04:37,798
Alright, first things first...

102
00:04:38,855 --> 00:04:39,702
...and next...

103
00:04:40,699 --> 00:04:41,502
...no, that's not it! ...

104
00:04:41,673 --> 00:04:43,216
...yeah. The third one! ...

105
00:04:43,817 --> 00:04:44,951
...almost done!

106
00:04:47,303 --> 00:04:47,879
Take care!

107
00:04:48,242 --> 00:04:49,0
Like this?

108
00:04:49,0 --> 00:04:50,433
Now, grab that wire from earlier and-

109
00:04:50,433 --> 00:04:54,603
Hurry, uncle! We're closing in on Oatland station! We're out of time!

110
00:04:54,603 --> 00:04:58,576
I know! Peruru, this is the last part! Press that switch on the right!

111
00:05:01,625 --> 00:05:06,307
Blastrain, can you hear me? Blastrain, you need to stop now! Blastrain!!

112
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:07,819
He's not responding!

113
00:05:07,819 --> 00:05:08,862
Was it too late?

114
00:05:08,862 --> 00:05:09,733
It can't be!

115
00:05:11,523 --> 00:05:14,418
What a peaceful start to the... day?!

116
00:05:17,271 --> 00:05:18,877
NOOOO!!!

117
00:05:46,237 --> 00:05:47,749
What was I doing...?

118
00:05:47,749 --> 00:05:49,572
You've regained consciousness...

119
00:05:51,524 --> 00:05:54,954
Mr. Conductor! Could you please take me to Oatland station?

120
00:05:54,954 --> 00:05:57,180
I have to... take you to...

121
00:05:57,180 --> 00:05:58,766
He-hey!! What are you doing?!

122
00:05:58,766 --> 00:06:01,408
To... Where, exactly...?

123
00:06:03,975 --> 00:06:09,279
I'm glad we didn't have a major accident, but Peruru and Ms. Mona are in danger! Let's hurry!

124
00:06:09,279 --> 00:06:09,759
Okay!

125
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:11,100
Jun, let me face him.

126
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:12,596
Blue Cop! But you're hurt!

127
00:06:12,596 --> 00:06:15,55
Blastrain is also injured.

128
00:06:15,55 --> 00:06:18,915
We need to seal him as soon as possible so he can recover in the Metal Breath.

129
00:06:18,915 --> 00:06:23,634
I want to save Blastrain too. And I'm the only one who can do it!

130
00:06:23,634 --> 00:06:25,109
Okay.

131
00:06:25,109 --> 00:06:26,569
I'll make an opening for you, then.

132
00:06:29,79 --> 00:06:30,819
Why are you in such a hurry?

133
00:06:32,394 --> 00:06:32,971
Jun!

134
00:06:32,971 --> 00:06:38,180
Blastrain! This is your last stop! Blue Cop! Superior Docking!

135
00:06:44,156 --> 00:06:44,899
Are you ready?

136
00:06:44,899 --> 00:06:45,569
Yes!

137
00:07:09,824 --> 00:07:13,309
Blastrain, let them go and come with us!

138
00:07:13,309 --> 00:07:16,216
The train will soon be arriving at Oatland Station-

139
00:07:16,216 --> 00:07:17,891
They'll get hurt if he fires that!

140
00:07:17,891 --> 00:07:18,572
Blue Cop!

141
00:07:20,19 --> 00:07:22,255
Peruru! Ms. Mona! Hang on tight!

142
00:07:25,776 --> 00:07:27,254
Peruru! Ms. Mona!

143
00:07:27,254 --> 00:07:28,111
Jump here, you two!

144
00:07:28,312 --> 00:07:29,139
Ma'am!

145
00:07:29,139 --> 00:07:29,814
Okay!

146
00:07:36,591 --> 00:07:38,338
Looks like they've started without us!

147
00:07:38,338 --> 00:07:39,386
Hurry up!

148
00:07:39,774 --> 00:07:41,521
Get yourself together, Blastrain!

149
00:07:41,521 --> 00:07:44,870
You've already arrived at your destination! You don't have to run anymore!

150
00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:49,816
A-Attention all passengers, please remain...

151
00:07:49,816 --> 00:07:51,667
Behind you, Blue Cop!

152
00:07:51,667 --> 00:07:52,800
...seated!

153
00:07:56,185 --> 00:08:01,343
Please refrain from verbally abusing or... Assaulting car attendants!

154
00:08:01,343 --> 00:08:02,375
Mr. Conductor!

155
00:08:02,997 --> 00:08:04,896
Blue Cop Trinity! Set up!

156
00:08:45,638 --> 00:08:51,120
The train will soon be arriving at our last stop, Star Guardian station!

157
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:53,269
Please, be prepared!

158
00:08:53,269 --> 00:08:55,917
Get ready, Blue Cop! Let's finish this!

159
00:08:55,917 --> 00:09:00,836
Wait! Don't hurt Mr. Blastrain! He's brought me all this way!

160
00:09:00,836 --> 00:09:03,400
Don't worry. We're just trying to let him rest.

161
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:04,386
That's right, Ms. Mona.

162
00:09:04,386 --> 00:09:04,998
Wh-when did you get here?

163
00:09:04,998 --> 00:09:09,610
He's just sick, so I'll fix him right up once they get the job done!

164
00:09:09,610 --> 00:09:11,732
We can trust uncle Edo's skills.

165
00:09:11,732 --> 00:09:14,433
He's fixed so many Metal Cardbots before!

166
00:09:14,433 --> 00:09:15,385
Like my tooth!

167
00:09:15,385 --> 00:09:16,770
And my butt!

168
00:09:16,984 --> 00:09:18,135
You can trust in us.

169
00:09:18,972 --> 00:09:21,220
Alright. I'm counting on you.

170
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:21,703
Alright!

171
00:09:22,830 --> 00:09:26,734
Last... Destination!!

172
00:09:28,370 --> 00:09:29,793
Galaxies... 

173
00:09:34,379 --> 00:09:36,491
Punisher!!

174
00:09:42,929 --> 00:09:46,373
Thank you... for.. riding with us...

175
00:09:51,317 --> 00:09:53,539
Metal Cardbot, change up!

176
00:10:07,506 --> 00:10:09,418
Blastrain, sealed!

177
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:13,883
Is Mr. Blastrain okay?!

178
00:10:13,883 --> 00:10:17,168
He's fine. We'll let him rest up in here for a while.

179
00:10:18,312 --> 00:10:19,963
We'll have him repaired soon.

180
00:10:20,264 --> 00:10:21,575
Thank goodness!

181
00:10:22,779 --> 00:10:24,465
Have a safe trip!

182
00:10:24,465 --> 00:10:26,456
Thank you again!

183
00:10:26,456 --> 00:10:28,118
All of our secrets have been revealed to her.

184
00:10:28,118 --> 00:10:31,768
I'm sure they'll be safe with Ms. Mona. Right, Uncle Edo?

185
00:10:31,768 --> 00:10:34,525
Please let Mao be okay, please let Mao be okay, please let Mao be okay...

186
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:38,129
So that conductor robot is like a...

187
00:10:38,129 --> 00:10:40,802
Another side of me that moves by my will.

188
00:10:40,802 --> 00:10:43,799
Woah, you guys can do that!?

189
00:10:43,799 --> 00:10:45,755
It's a little bit strange to see a human sized Metal Cardbot.

190
00:10:45,755 --> 00:10:47,379
Inspection all done.

191
00:10:47,504 --> 00:10:49,239
Jun, Thank you very much.

192
00:10:49,239 --> 00:10:51,923
Don't mention it. You should thank Peruru and Blue Cop instead of me.

193
00:10:51,923 --> 00:10:53,164
Aren't you forgetting someone?

194
00:10:53,164 --> 00:10:54,241
Excuse me!

195
00:10:54,241 --> 00:10:55,740
Ah, Ms. Mona!

196
00:10:55,740 --> 00:10:58,120
Thanks for what you did back then. Here.

197
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:00,404
Aw, you didn't have to! I'm just doing my job-

198
00:11:00,404 --> 00:11:02,224
Is Mr. Blastrain okay now?

199
00:11:02,224 --> 00:11:05,274
Eh? Oh yeah, he is. I took good care of him!

200
00:11:05,274 --> 00:11:07,202
Ah, Ms. Mona?

201
00:11:07,202 --> 00:11:07,745
Yes!

202
00:11:07,745 --> 00:11:12,149
I heard about what happened. I am terribly sorry for putting you in danger.

203
00:11:12,149 --> 00:11:13,383
Don't worry yourself over that.

204
00:11:13,383 --> 00:11:16,211
Anyway, Ms. Mona, is your brother okay?

205
00:11:16,211 --> 00:11:17,610
My brother?

206
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:19,144
Was it... Mao, right?

207
00:11:19,144 --> 00:11:23,881
Ah, Mao is... My pet dog living at my parent's house! 

208
00:11:23,881 --> 00:11:28,153
He's all better thanks to you. He's made a full recovery!

209
00:11:28,153 --> 00:11:30,193
Aww, so cute!

210
00:11:30,193 --> 00:11:31,301
Mr. Blastrain?

211
00:11:31,301 --> 00:11:31,716
Ma'am?

212
00:11:31,716 --> 00:11:33,150
Thank you very much.

213
00:11:37,236 --> 00:11:38,808
He's malfunctioning again.

214
00:11:38,808 --> 00:11:42,398
Uncle Edo! Why didn't you fix him properly?!
