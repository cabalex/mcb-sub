1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:01,911
The Return of Steel

2
00:00:09,855 --> 00:00:11,118
What was that?

3
00:00:11,419 --> 00:00:13,400
You're... You're Jun's...

4
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:16,260
Yep! We're all friends of Jun!

5
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:18,234
All of thou are his...?

6
00:00:18,234 --> 00:00:19,126
Sky Gallop?!

7
00:00:19,126 --> 00:00:22,181
Everyone we've met from Planet Machina so far has become another one of Jun's friends.

8
00:00:22,181 --> 00:00:24,149
And you'll be one of them soon enough, Sky Gallop.

9
00:00:24,149 --> 00:00:25,152
I'm sure of it!

10
00:00:25,152 --> 00:00:27,167
Hm. We shall see.

11
00:00:27,167 --> 00:00:31,469
So Jun and those guys are the best of friends, just like Mukara was to us...

12
00:00:31,768 --> 00:00:33,731
Are you saying we aren't, Red Blitz?

13
00:00:34,432 --> 00:00:37,310
Heh! Of course you're our friend too, Jun!

14
00:00:37,310 --> 00:00:41,145
Alright, everyone! It's time to gather all of our strength!

15
00:00:41,145 --> 00:00:41,749
Mega Ambler!

16
00:00:41,749 --> 00:00:42,380
Right.

17
00:00:45,676 --> 00:00:47,340
Our stamina is coming back!

18
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:50,798
It's a temporary fix. It's to prepare for the pain to come later.

19
00:00:50,798 --> 00:00:51,831
And don't forget to pay for your treatment.

20
00:00:51,831 --> 00:00:53,228
Oh, we have to pay for that...?

21
00:00:53,228 --> 00:00:55,390
I'll fix you all up when we're done, don't worry!

22
00:00:55,390 --> 00:00:58,246
Increasing your numbers won't change anything!

23
00:00:58,246 --> 00:00:59,173
Not a chance!

24
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:06,676
The brothers are not acting like themselves.

25
00:01:07,239 --> 00:01:09,384
It looks like those foreign objects in their bodies are the reason why.

26
00:01:09,384 --> 00:01:11,329
I'm detecting some abnormal energy readings from them!

27
00:01:11,329 --> 00:01:14,733
That false power will confound those two brothers.

28
00:01:14,733 --> 00:01:17,414
He took away their freedom of choice... I shall not forgive him!

29
00:01:17,414 --> 00:01:19,692
Then we'll save them!

30
00:01:19,692 --> 00:01:22,554
Hm? I see that Flame Nova has the same object!

31
00:01:22,554 --> 00:01:25,182
Could that be another hidden treasure of Deus Machina?

32
00:01:25,182 --> 00:01:28,210
If that's the case, that power will be mine!

33
00:01:28,210 --> 00:01:30,245
You think I'll just let you have it?!

34
00:01:30,245 --> 00:01:31,533
W-wait!

35
00:01:34,706 --> 00:01:36,966
You want it? Then come and take it from me!

36
00:01:40,811 --> 00:01:44,685
Let them handle Flame Nova for now. Peruru! Let's fight together!

37
00:01:44,685 --> 00:01:46,110
You got it, Jun!

38
00:01:48,289 --> 00:01:50,200
Metal Breath! Pick Up! (FX-both)

39
00:01:50,793 --> 00:01:51,233

44
00:02:08,925 --> 00:02:10,824
Cielo! Homing Magnum! (FX-mukara)

45
00:02:15,717 --> 00:02:17,271
Where are you looking?

46
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:19,948
Dexter! (FX-jun)

47
00:02:19,948 --> 00:02:20,485
Rock Crush! (FX-mukara)

48
00:02:20,485 --> 00:02:21,472

00:02:32,492 --> 00:02:34,557
Trident Submarine!! (FX-busterGallon)

54
00:02:34,557 --> 00:02:36,724
Heli-Tornado!! (FX-shadowX)

55
00:02:39,288 --> 00:02:40,264
Now!

56
00:02:41,194 --> 00:02:42,305
Buffalo Crush! (FX-jun)

57
00:02:42,305 --> 00:02:43,389
Musclehyde! (FX-mukara)

58
00:02:43,389 --> 00:02:44,597
Are you ready?

59
00:02:45,950 --> 00:02:46,670
Bronto!! (FX-mukara)

60
00:02:46,770 --> 00:02:48,521
Strike!! (FX-bold musclehyde)

61
00:02:48,521 --> 00:02:49,710

63
00:02:55,435 --> 00:02:55,837

Red Blitz! (FX-mukara right)

65
00:02:57,418 --> 00:02:58,408
Set Up!! (FX-both xl bold)

66
00:02:58,408 --> 00:02:59,799
Mega Crimson...! (FX-mukara)

67
00:02:59,799 --> 00:03:01,764
Meteor Bolt...! (FX-jun)

68
00:03:04,401 --> 00:03:06,953
KICK!!! PUNCH!!! (FX-split bold)

69
00:03:10,419 --> 00:03:12,187
Milady. Grant me the honor of finishing them.

70
00:03:12,288 --> 00:03:13,316
Okay!

71
00:03:13,977 --> 00:03:15,507
Sky Gallop! Set Up!

72
00:03:26,579 --> 00:03:28,270
We shall reunite soon.

73
00:03:28,270 --> 00:03:29,210
S...Sorry...

74
00:03:29,210 --> 00:03:30,449
Thank... you...

75
00:03:33,417 --> 00:03:35,866
Metal Cardbot! Change Up! (FX-both bold)

76
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:44,608

Flash Vector! (FX-jun left)

Sealed!! (FX-both bold xl)

79
00:03:49,209 --> 00:03:51,662
As expected, they're not capable of handling this power!

80
00:03:51,662 --> 00:03:53,305
You're the only one left!

81
00:03:53,305 --> 00:03:54,920
Just give up already!

82
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:56,644
Speak for yourselves!!

83
00:04:14,816 --> 00:04:16,396
This is getting annoying.

84
00:04:16,396 --> 00:04:18,567
Now that's more like it.

85
00:04:18,567 --> 00:04:21,221
My people... Must survive!

86
00:04:21,221 --> 00:04:23,271
Jun! Looks like it's my turn, ain't it?

87
00:04:24,170 --> 00:04:26,213
Everyone, give your energy to Mega Trucker!

88
00:04:26,213 --> 00:04:27,144
Roger!!

89
00:04:29,434 --> 00:04:30,639
You coming or what?!

90
00:04:34,268 --> 00:04:37,959
Giga Flame Impact!!! (FX-phoenixFire bold xl)

91
00:04:38,536 --> 00:04:41,858
Mega Power Shield!!! (FX-megaTrucker bold xl)

92
00:04:50,269 --> 00:04:51,298
How about that, huh?

93
00:04:51,298 --> 00:04:53,365
Great job, everyone. We'll handle the rest.

94
00:04:53,365 --> 00:04:55,399
Jun. I'll stay here.

95
00:05:05,841 --> 00:05:07,129
The Speranza's increasing speed!

96
00:05:07,129 --> 00:05:09,564
Flame Nova! What are you planning?!

97
00:05:11,584 --> 00:05:13,980
Ah, the Speranza is...!

98
00:05:17,516 --> 00:05:19,447
It's coming this way!

99
00:05:19,447 --> 00:05:20,620
- Huh?
- Wha?!

100
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:22,451
Stop the Speranza right now!

101
00:05:22,951 --> 00:05:25,228
Why don't you defeat me and do it yourself?

102
00:05:25,805 --> 00:05:26,915
Give us some time!

103
00:05:27,692 --> 00:05:29,663
We'll get the door to the bridge open sure enough!

104
00:05:29,663 --> 00:05:31,757
Trust us and fight to your heart's content, guys!

105
00:05:32,158 --> 00:05:35,197
Jun! This card is it, right?

106
00:05:35,197 --> 00:05:36,250
Yeah!

107
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:36,973
Blue Cop!

108
00:05:36,973 --> 00:05:37,853
Roger!

109
00:05:37,853 --> 00:05:39,326
Superior Docking!! (FX-blueShine bold)

110
00:05:41,887 --> 00:05:45,204
Blue Cop Trinity! Set Up!! (FX-trinity)

111
00:06:02,509 --> 00:06:05,584
Blue Cop, now you're big enough to stand up to me!

112
00:06:05,584 --> 00:06:09,627
Flame Nova, you were once hailed as a hero. What happened to you?

113
00:06:09,627 --> 00:06:11,213
You know nothing.

114
00:06:11,213 --> 00:06:15,199
Do you realize the true reason why Deus Machina entrusted you with that Metal Breath?

115
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:16,680
I can't know everything...

116
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:19,165
but I can tell you that it's not what you think it is!

117
00:06:19,165 --> 00:06:20,997
You foolish subordinate!!

118
00:06:21,221 --> 00:06:23,382
Prominence Cannon!! (FX-phoenixFire bold)

119
00:06:24,593 --> 00:06:27,680
You traitors who side with the humans will not stop me!

120
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:28,682
Blastrain!

121
00:06:32,677 --> 00:06:33,987
Gigantrex!

122
00:06:33,987 --> 00:06:36,269
Rex!! Inferno!!! (FX-gigantrex bold)

123
00:06:37,158 --> 00:06:38,411
Not... A chance!

124
00:06:38,411 --> 00:06:40,379
That guy is tough as all heck! Jun!

125
00:06:40,379 --> 00:06:43,170
Okay! Black Hook! Set Up!

126
00:06:44,129 --> 00:06:45,533
Captain's... (FX-jun)

127
00:06:45,533 --> 00:06:47,699
CANNON!!! (FX-blackHook bold)

128
00:06:50,968 --> 00:06:52,927
Peruru's mother! We need to get away from here!

129
00:06:54,798 --> 00:06:56,192
That cable must be it!

130
00:06:56,192 --> 00:06:57,906
Come on, come on!! Work!!

131
00:07:00,850 --> 00:07:02,494
Just how strong is that son of a gun?!

132
00:07:02,494 --> 00:07:04,382
Let me handle this, twerp.

133
00:07:04,382 --> 00:07:05,552
I said to call me Jun!

134
00:07:05,954 --> 00:07:07,444
Heavy Iron! Set Up! (FX-jun)

135
00:07:12,973 --> 00:07:14,175
Heavy... (FX-jun)

00:07:14,175 --> 00:07:15,175
BUSTER... (FX-heavyIron xl bold)

137
00:07:15,175 --> 00:07:16,600
CANNON!!! (FX-heavyIron xxl bold italic)

138
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:17,492
Blue Cop!

139
00:07:26,937 --> 00:07:31,387
Looks like the so-called hero of the Star Guardians is not capable of handling that power, either.

140
00:07:31,387 --> 00:07:33,191
Blue Cop! Wild Guardy!

141
00:07:33,191 --> 00:07:33,894
Let's end this!

142
00:07:33,894 --> 00:07:34,382
Roger! (FX-left blueCop)

143
00:07:34,382 --> 00:07:34,788
Got it! (FX-right wildGuardy)

144
00:07:34,988 --> 00:07:36,596
Wild Guardy! Set Up!

145
00:07:39,879 --> 00:07:41,699
Everyone! Let our powers combine!!

146
00:07:43,735 --> 00:07:45,483
I'll let you finish him.

147
00:07:45,983 --> 00:07:46,663
Let's go!

148
00:07:49,711 --> 00:07:50,875
This time for sure...!!

149
00:07:51,574 --> 00:07:52,555
Uncle!!

150
00:07:55,307 --> 00:07:56,360
Master Crest!

151
00:07:57,348 --> 00:07:57,913
Captain!

152
00:07:57,913 --> 00:08:00,658
Right. Red Blitz! Head to the bridge right this instant!

153
00:08:00,658 --> 00:08:02,107
Uh, m-me?

154
00:08:02,107 --> 00:08:03,752
I'm speaking to you and no one else!

155
00:08:03,752 --> 00:08:04,899
Just do as we taught you.

156
00:08:04,899 --> 00:08:05,661
Now go!

157
00:08:06,261 --> 00:08:07,663
O-okay!

158
00:08:16,149 --> 00:08:17,877
Don't have too much fun without me.

159
00:08:17,877 --> 00:08:21,156
I shall aid thee as well. Vector and Bit Brothers, join us!

160
00:08:21,156 --> 00:08:22,408
But we're...

161
00:08:22,408 --> 00:08:24,237
Bro! Let's give it a try!

162
00:08:24,237 --> 00:08:25,379
...Very well.

163
00:08:38,321 --> 00:08:41,743
Come here. You need to learn how to control the rudder in case something happens, don't you think? (FX-italic)

164
00:08:41,743 --> 00:08:43,840
Let's start with the basics. First you need to- (FX-italic)

165
00:08:47,298 --> 00:08:49,431
Galaxies... (FX-blueCop bold)

166
00:08:49,431 --> 00:08:50,923
Wild... (FX-wildGuardy bold)

167
00:08:56,893 --> 00:08:59,201
PUNISHER!!! (FX-punisher)

168
00:09:14,942 --> 00:09:16,219
Flame Nova...

169
00:09:16,219 --> 00:09:20,697
Earth... is a world where humans and Metal Cardbots can live together!

170
00:09:30,599 --> 00:09:33,346
Blue Cop... I saw it...

171
00:09:33,346 --> 00:09:38,370
At the lowest level of planet Machina.... There lies Metal Cardbot's very... First...

172
00:09:44,548 --> 00:09:44,892
Jun!

173
00:09:44,892 --> 00:09:46,269
Hey, guys!

174
00:09:50,397 --> 00:09:51,437
Mom!

175
00:09:51,437 --> 00:09:52,618
Peruru!

176
00:09:53,673 --> 00:09:55,157
You had me worried sick!

177
00:09:55,157 --> 00:09:57,270
I can't breathe, Mom!

178
00:09:57,270 --> 00:10:00,349
The train to Mowtown, Mowtown, will be departing soon!

179
00:10:00,349 --> 00:10:03,129
If you need any repairs, come stop by my car center whenever you'd like.

180
00:10:03,129 --> 00:10:05,716
We'll be sure to, once we're finished here.

181
00:10:06,115 --> 00:10:08,738
I'll stay and search for the Organizer that fell into the ocean.

182
00:10:08,738 --> 00:10:10,759
I owe uncle Rex, after all.

183
00:10:10,759 --> 00:10:11,812
We'll be waiting for you.

184
00:10:11,812 --> 00:10:13,533
See ya later, pal.

185
00:10:13,533 --> 00:10:14,903
Take care of yourself.

186
00:10:14,903 --> 00:10:16,707
We have decided to help settle the situation as well.

187
00:10:16,707 --> 00:10:17,177
Hmph.

188
00:10:17,177 --> 00:10:18,596
Yeah, it's only fair.

189
00:10:18,596 --> 00:10:20,351
Thank you, everyone!

190
00:10:20,351 --> 00:10:22,509
But it's too bad. You didn't get to see the temple.

191
00:10:22,509 --> 00:10:25,279
Our parents will be worried if we're gone too long.

192
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:26,649
We'll visit you again!

193
00:10:26,649 --> 00:10:27,845
Don't you forget!

194
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:29,836
Jun!

195
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:32,283
You're just the greatest.

196
00:10:32,283 --> 00:10:33,918
You're a wonder itself.

197
00:10:33,918 --> 00:10:35,961
We're lucky to have met you.

198
00:10:35,961 --> 00:10:38,335
Ahahaha! You guys are embarrassing me!

199
00:10:38,335 --> 00:10:39,692
Jun!

200
00:10:39,692 --> 00:10:41,235
I had a lot of fun!

201
00:10:42,437 --> 00:10:45,158
Me too! Everyone, see you again!

202
00:10:46,436 --> 00:10:49,596
Blue Cop! Your friend there is one of the best!

203
00:10:49,596 --> 00:10:50,661
He sure is!

204
00:10:53,311 --> 00:10:54,754
Jun!

205
00:10:54,754 --> 00:10:56,721
Thank you for everything!!

206
00:10:56,721 --> 00:10:58,614
So long!!

207
00:11:00,470 --> 00:11:02,201
Someday, we will have to leave as well.

208
00:11:02,201 --> 00:11:03,899
Do you really have to go?

209
00:11:03,899 --> 00:11:06,519
This planet was not our original destination.

210
00:11:06,519 --> 00:11:09,538
But... We'll need more time before we can continue our journey.

211
00:11:10,139 --> 00:11:12,494
Now, it's only natural you seal me as well, yes?

212
00:11:12,494 --> 00:11:15,750
Use the token of our friendship... Peruru.

213
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:16,500
Okay!

214
00:11:16,899 --> 00:11:19,388
Metal Cardbot! Change Up!

215
00:11:22,485 --> 00:11:25,524
Jun. Jun! Look at this.

216
00:11:25,524 --> 00:11:27,951
This is the group photo we took earlier. It looks great, right?

217
00:11:27,951 --> 00:11:29,494
What do you think of my skills?

218
00:11:29,793 --> 00:11:30,917
Woah!

219
00:11:30,917 --> 00:11:31,995
Jun! Let me see it! (FX-blueCop)

220
00:11:31,995 --> 00:11:32,947
Me too! Me too! (FX-shadowX)

221
00:11:32,947 --> 00:11:34,495
It's nice to have a bunch of new bots around! (FX-megaTrucker)

222
00:11:34,495 --> 00:11:36,562
Those heavenly wings... They were so beautiful. (FX-fletaZ)

223
00:11:36,562 --> 00:11:37,417
Me miss Yuri. (FX-buffaloCrush)

224
00:11:37,417 --> 00:11:39,571
Yarr! Let's party when we get back home! (FX-blackHook)

225
00:11:39,571 --> 00:11:42,196
Before we do that, I have something I need to say to you all...
