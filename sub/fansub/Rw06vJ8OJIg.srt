1
00:00:01,962 --> 00:00:04,950
Reunion with Gigantrex!

2
00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:14,884
Abyss... This must be it.

3
00:00:14,884 --> 00:00:17,585
This is the freighter that was carrying the 4th Metal Card tablet.

4
00:00:19,254 --> 00:00:20,963
Master Crest, is this...?

5
00:00:21,449 --> 00:00:24,225
So you woke up too, Gigantrex...!

6
00:00:24,625 --> 00:00:26,861
Angry face, not angry face, angry face...

7
00:00:26,861 --> 00:00:29,861
...not angry face, angry face, not angry face...
This is how you brew a tasty cup of coffee.

8
00:00:29,861 --> 00:00:31,917
Cielo, I'm working on my notes.

9
00:00:31,917 --> 00:00:33,420
Okay, keep going~

10
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:34,484
Gigantrex?!

11
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:41,380
The freighter that went missing three days ago off the coast of Mowtown may have sunk from an attack by Gigantrex.

12
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:42,225
That's not possible!

13
00:00:42,225 --> 00:00:46,136
"Get along with the humans." The Captain always said that.

14
00:00:46,136 --> 00:00:49,154
Could it have been in an accident, like with Musclehyde?

15
00:00:49,154 --> 00:00:53,457
Perhaps. That's why I'm not jumping to conclusions just yet. There's another thing that bothers me. 

16
00:00:53,457 --> 00:00:55,173
What do you mean?

17
00:00:55,173 --> 00:00:58,938
While we were investigating the freighter, we were ambushed by another Metal Cardbot.

18
00:01:00,273 --> 00:01:00,904
What's going on?

19
00:01:00,904 --> 00:01:02,664
Master Crest, look over there!

20
00:01:09,980 --> 00:01:10,890
Can we shake it off?

21
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:13,878
Absolutely! Ejecting drones!

22
00:01:29,888 --> 00:01:32,218
A submarine that looks like a shark?

23
00:01:32,218 --> 00:01:33,883
Does that ring any bells?

24
00:01:33,883 --> 00:01:34,543
No.

25
00:01:34,543 --> 00:01:36,109
We don't have any colleagues like that.

26
00:01:36,109 --> 00:01:38,430
What's a shark?

27
00:01:59,727 --> 00:02:03,989
You should have given way earlier. Why would you even...

28
00:02:15,586 --> 00:02:17,704
Wh-w-w-w-what are they doing?!

29
00:02:41,586 --> 00:02:45,586
This is Edo Motors- Oh, it's you, Uncle Edo. What?
Jun! I'm in trouble!! Big trouble!! A Metal Cardbot showed up!!

30
00:02:45,586 --> 00:02:47,139
A Metal Cardbot?!

31
00:02:47,781 --> 00:02:48,896
Is it a submarine?

32
00:02:48,896 --> 00:02:51,590
I told you I was on the road! It was a gigantic semi-trailer truck!

33
00:02:51,590 --> 00:02:52,323
Trailer truck?

34
00:02:52,323 --> 00:02:53,543
Could it be?
The Captain! 

35
00:02:53,543 --> 00:02:55,288
Uncle, where are you now?

36
00:02:55,603 --> 00:02:59,324
The Route 4 Rest Area. I'm on a mountain road with no cell service, so I called from a pay pho-

37
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:17,740
Uncle Edo!

38
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:19,324
We'd better go look for him.

39
00:03:19,324 --> 00:03:21,174
If we're facing the Captain, you can count us in!

40
00:03:21,174 --> 00:03:22,568
Alright, let's hurry!

41
00:03:30,634 --> 00:03:33,741
Hey! I just fixed this car!

42
00:03:40,637 --> 00:03:42,932
Ah... I should have asked her to go out with me.

43
00:03:42,932 --> 00:03:46,542
WAAAAAAAHHHHH!!!

44
00:03:51,174 --> 00:03:52,978
You alright, Edo?

45
00:03:52,978 --> 00:03:55,418
Th... thank you... Cielo...

46
00:04:10,318 --> 00:04:12,525
WAAAAHHH!! It's so good to see you, Jun!!

47
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:14,990
G-Glad you're okay...

48
00:04:20,396 --> 00:04:22,418
T-t-t-that's the semi-truck!

49
00:04:25,139 --> 00:04:26,971
That appearance... it must be him!

50
00:04:26,971 --> 00:04:28,278
It's the Captain!

51
00:04:39,949 --> 00:04:41,576
That's Gigantrex?

52
00:04:41,855 --> 00:04:43,220
He's huge!

53
00:04:43,836 --> 00:04:46,437
His size is on par with Heavy Iron...

54
00:04:47,355 --> 00:04:49,478
Captain! I missed you!

55
00:04:52,377 --> 00:04:53,584
Wait! Cielo!

56
00:05:03,189 --> 00:05:04,583
Captain... why...?

57
00:05:04,583 --> 00:05:06,685
Something must be wrong with him.

58
00:05:07,182 --> 00:05:09,247
This isn't the Captain we knew!

59
00:05:13,968 --> 00:05:15,490
Mukara?

60
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:17,310
No. I'm Jun!

61
00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:21,932
Why are you wearing the Metal Breath that I gave to Mukara?

62
00:05:21,932 --> 00:05:25,725
It's a long story, but I'm keeping it for now!

63
00:05:25,725 --> 00:05:30,451
The Metal Breath is a sign of trust between humans and Metal Cardbots.

64
00:05:34,858 --> 00:05:38,137
But humans have trampled on that trust. 

65
00:05:39,298 --> 00:05:44,625
I believed that someday, surely, there would come a day when we could live together...

66
00:05:44,625 --> 00:05:46,581
But, you humans have broke that tru-

67
00:05:46,581 --> 00:05:50,163
Wait! Do you even realize that it's been 4,000 years since you all went to sleep?

68
00:05:50,163 --> 00:05:51,485
Who are you?

69
00:05:51,485 --> 00:05:53,771
I am the one who inherited the lineage of Mukara!

70
00:05:55,771 --> 00:05:59,713
A descendant of Mukara? If that's so, I must not forgive you!

71
00:05:59,713 --> 00:06:00,298
What?!

72
00:06:01,0 --> 00:06:03,338
I entrusted humans with my dream.

73
00:06:03,338 --> 00:06:03,975
A dream?

74
00:06:03,975 --> 00:06:06,538
You mean a world where humans and Metal Cardbots can coexist?

75
00:06:06,538 --> 00:06:08,758
No, progress!

76
00:06:08,758 --> 00:06:12,358
I wanted human civilization to advance through the power of science.

77
00:06:12,358 --> 00:06:16,274
But! You humans monopolized the fruits of your budding civilization!

78
00:06:16,274 --> 00:06:18,37
Wait, wait! We never monopolized anythi-

79
00:06:18,37 --> 00:06:20,725
I do not need your excuses!

80
00:06:27,730 --> 00:06:32,466
Why are you doing this, Captain? You've told us over and over to get along with humans!

81
00:06:35,389 --> 00:06:39,151
It won't be easy, but I'll need all of your help to persuade Gigantrex.

82
00:06:39,151 --> 00:06:40,697
We're counting on you, everyone!

83
00:06:40,697 --> 00:06:42,345
Sigh... okay.

84
00:06:42,345 --> 00:06:43,875
S-sure!

85
00:06:43,875 --> 00:06:44,800
Cielo...

86
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:46,668
Don't worry.

87
00:06:49,153 --> 00:06:50,882
Let's do it with a series of attacks!

88
00:06:50,882 --> 00:06:51,877
Roger!

89
00:06:53,215 --> 00:06:54,887
Cielo! Set up!

90
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:08,319
Cielo! Skyjet Shot!

91
00:07:22,273 --> 00:07:23,269
Cielo!

92
00:07:25,225 --> 00:07:26,954
Musclehyde! Set up!

93
00:07:29,670 --> 00:07:30,819
Dreadnought Storm!

94
00:07:32,829 --> 00:07:35,934
Dreadnought Storm!!

95
00:07:57,115 --> 00:07:58,875
That's our Captain.

96
00:07:58,875 --> 00:08:00,778
That old man is still strong, even after all these years!

97
00:08:00,778 --> 00:08:02,625
Do you think now is the time for compliments?!

98
00:08:03,915 --> 00:08:04,586
Are you next?

99
00:08:04,586 --> 00:08:08,117
M-me?! Waaahhh!!

100
00:08:08,117 --> 00:08:09,824
Hmph. What a weakling.

101
00:08:09,824 --> 00:08:11,110
Say that again!

102
00:08:11,110 --> 00:08:11,908
What?

103
00:08:21,415 --> 00:08:22,531
He's good!

104
00:08:27,694 --> 00:08:28,646
Now!

105
00:08:33,163 --> 00:08:34,892
Rock Crush! Set up!

106
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,206
Blizzard Age!

107
00:08:51,446 --> 00:08:52,951
I-I-I'm sorry!!

108
00:08:53,250 --> 00:08:54,565
Let's finish this, Blue Cop!

109
00:09:06,605 --> 00:09:09,966
Blue Cop! Meteor Bolt Punch!

110
00:09:11,230 --> 00:09:13,307
Meteor Bolt...!

111
00:09:37,942 --> 00:09:40,855
Punch!!

112
00:09:46,690 --> 00:09:47,551
Death Grip.

113
00:09:57,350 --> 00:09:58,841
Blue Cop! Rock Crush!

114
00:09:59,619 --> 00:10:01,552
This is the end for you.

115
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:08,725
Jun!

116
00:10:08,725 --> 00:10:10,235
Hey! What do you think you're doing?!

117
00:10:10,235 --> 00:10:16,754
You're right. Even after 4,000 years, we have yet to see a world where humans and Metal Cardbots can live together. 

118
00:10:16,754 --> 00:10:20,884
But maybe next year, by the 4,001st year, it'll be possible!

119
00:10:20,884 --> 00:10:23,442
What Jun said! Believe in us!

120
00:10:26,710 --> 00:10:27,778
Silence!

121
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:29,550
Captain! Stop!!

122
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:43,245
This light... I've seen this before..!

123
00:10:52,639 --> 00:10:55,177
Does this mean... I am wrong...?!

124
00:10:58,480 --> 00:10:59,423
Captain!

125
00:11:01,975 --> 00:11:03,120
He left.

126
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,586
What just happened?

127
00:11:07,806 --> 00:11:11,331
Well well, a pretty bothersome fellow has shown up...

128
00:11:13,690 --> 00:11:17,355
I don't wanna see that scary guy ever again!

129
00:11:17,355 --> 00:11:21,417
I've never seen him act like this. Such aggression... That's not my Captain.

130
00:11:21,417 --> 00:11:24,418
Maybe something happened on that cargo ship.

131
00:11:24,418 --> 00:11:25,961
What do you mean?

132
00:11:25,961 --> 00:11:28,504
I saw a wound on his head.

133
00:11:29,149 --> 00:11:30,562
That was on my mind too.

134
00:11:30,562 --> 00:11:34,105
That could be why he occasionally touched his head...

135
00:11:34,105 --> 00:11:37,504
Maybe that's the cause for his recent actions.
