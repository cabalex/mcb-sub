1
00:00:01,644 --> 00:00:05,238
The Secret is Out!

2
00:00:10,624 --> 00:00:13,816
Hey, Dad! Do you know what's up tomorrow?

3
00:00:13,816 --> 00:00:16,495
Tell me what's happening tomorrow ðŸŽµ

4
00:00:16,679 --> 00:00:19,107
Did you forget? I'll give you a hint, it's-

5
00:00:19,107 --> 00:00:21,772
Was it your time to clean up?

6
00:00:21,772 --> 00:00:23,491
No, I mean something more special-

7
00:00:23,491 --> 00:00:27,428
Is it the spring clean? Your room is a bit of a mess, you know.

8
00:00:27,428 --> 00:00:31,102
Why don't you also get to the garage and garden while you're at it, huh?

9
00:00:31,102 --> 00:00:33,541
Ugh...

10
00:00:42,895 --> 00:00:46,119
Hm? Vera!

11
00:00:46,119 --> 00:00:47,498
What are you looking at?

12
00:00:47,498 --> 00:00:48,703
At Jun!

13
00:00:48,703 --> 00:00:52,226
Huh? Jun? Wait... Vera, do you have a crush on-

14
00:00:52,226 --> 00:00:53,385
No!!

15
00:00:53,385 --> 00:00:56,401
I'm just keep an eye on him. He's hiding something!

16
00:00:56,401 --> 00:00:57,628
Hiding something?

17
00:00:57,628 --> 00:01:01,552
Yes! It's a top secret thing that would make FBI agents go after him!

18
00:01:01,552 --> 00:01:03,222
You'd better watch out!

19
00:01:05,176 --> 00:01:06,936
A top secret thing...?

20
00:01:07,917 --> 00:01:10,121
Metal Breath... pickup...

21
00:01:18,499 --> 00:01:20,223
Mega Trucker... setup...

22
00:01:37,549 --> 00:01:39,229
Now... come at me!

23
00:01:50,834 --> 00:01:51,891
Very well!

24
00:01:51,891 --> 00:01:55,435
I think I could make your shield even stronger with a little tricking.

25
00:01:55,509 --> 00:01:59,310
Huh, really? Then let's do it right away!

26
00:01:59,419 --> 00:02:04,457
It's not that easy. The stronger the shield, the more energy it consumes, you know?

27
00:02:04,457 --> 00:02:06,826
What if it stops working when you need it?

28
00:02:07,23 --> 00:02:09,298
Come back, Mega Trucker!

29
00:02:13,328 --> 00:02:15,277
I'll be off now, Uncle Edo...

30
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,239
What? Leaving so soon?

31
00:02:17,239 --> 00:02:21,7
It's my turn to clean up, ahaha...

32
00:02:21,624 --> 00:02:25,343
Hey, why is he acting so weird?

33
00:02:29,942 --> 00:02:31,748
Secret? With Jun?

34
00:02:32,32 --> 00:02:34,391
Mhm. Do you know anything?

35
00:02:34,391 --> 00:02:36,524
Oh, uh...

36
00:02:38,673 --> 00:02:39,654
Attack!

37
00:02:44,215 --> 00:02:45,378
Let's go!

38
00:02:45,619 --> 00:02:47,275
You got it, Blue Cop!

39
00:02:47,443 --> 00:02:49,327
Seal complete!

40
00:02:49,394 --> 00:02:51,752
I might say... uh...

41
00:02:51,752 --> 00:02:53,996
What is it, Theo?! Tell me!

42
00:02:53,996 --> 00:02:55,648
Actually, actually...

43
00:02:55,888 --> 00:02:57,834
Well Jun is...

44
00:02:57,834 --> 00:02:59,37
Yeah?

45
00:02:59,37 --> 00:03:00,829
It's his birthday today!

46
00:03:00,829 --> 00:03:03,995
Oh-aha! That was it?

47
00:03:03,995 --> 00:03:05,668
Y-Yeah, that's it...

48
00:03:05,668 --> 00:03:09,885
Oh, Theo, you should have told me! I misunderstood!

49
00:03:09,885 --> 00:03:12,130
Then... we should go celebrate!

50
00:03:12,130 --> 00:03:13,550
...celebrate?

51
00:03:13,550 --> 00:03:17,566
Yes! We should get a cake and go to Jun's right now!

52
00:03:17,566 --> 00:03:19,877
S-shouldn't we call before we go-

53
00:03:19,877 --> 00:03:25,266
But that's no fun! I'm sure Jun would like a surprise event too!

54
00:03:25,266 --> 00:03:28,655
Oh no, this does not feel good...

55
00:03:33,933 --> 00:03:38,468
It's my birthday and I'm mowing the lawn!!

56
00:03:38,468 --> 00:03:42,462
Mom, Dad, everyone, I'm not feeling loved today...

57
00:03:42,462 --> 00:03:44,420
Jun, what are you up to?

58
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:46,480
Can't you see? I'm mowing the lawn!

59
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:50,164
Looks fun! Can I try? Please, I wanna try!

60
00:03:55,122 --> 00:03:56,957
Woohoo!

61
00:03:57,12 --> 00:03:58,563
Is it fun?

62
00:03:59,409 --> 00:04:01,682
Haha! It's the best!

63
00:04:03,338 --> 00:04:06,205
Hey, Jun! Let me do something, Jun!

64
00:04:12,325 --> 00:04:14,688
Haha! This is fun!

65
00:04:14,826 --> 00:04:15,285
Woohoo!

66
00:04:15,285 --> 00:04:17,972
I'm happy that you guys are happy...

67
00:04:18,95 --> 00:04:19,94
Jun.

68
00:04:20,335 --> 00:04:23,484
What if someone sees them? We agreed that Metal Cardbots should be a secret.

69
00:04:23,484 --> 00:04:25,644
That's true...

70
00:04:27,135 --> 00:04:29,533
Ah, Blue Cop! Come here and help me!

71
00:04:29,605 --> 00:04:31,140
But don't let anyone see you!

72
00:04:31,943 --> 00:04:34,792
Hey buddy, wasn't the food today the worst- huh?

73
00:04:36,31 --> 00:04:40,180
This street has been closed. Please use the other street.

74
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:41,200
Let's just go play games.

75
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:42,780
Yeah, I agree... let's go.

76
00:04:44,50 --> 00:04:46,480
...should we really be doing this?

77
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:48,690
Come on. Nothing is going to happen. Just relax.

78
00:04:51,689 --> 00:04:53,285
Oh, excuse me!

79
00:04:53,611 --> 00:04:55,870
I'm sorry, this area is out of bounds.

80
00:04:55,870 --> 00:04:56,890
...huh?

81
00:04:56,944 --> 00:05:01,605
Hi, I'm sorry, but we just need to get over there. Could you just let us through?

82
00:05:01,605 --> 00:05:05,485
But, uh... well, uh...

83
00:05:05,485 --> 00:05:08,6
Oh, it's you!

84
00:05:08,6 --> 00:05:11,233
Perhaps... you could go ask the person... in charge?

85
00:05:11,233 --> 00:05:14,417
Oh, haha, right. Hold on a minute!

86
00:05:15,727 --> 00:05:18,202
Okay, let them through!

87
00:05:18,202 --> 00:05:19,472
What's going on?

88
00:05:19,472 --> 00:05:21,84
Theo has come over.

89
00:05:25,179 --> 00:05:26,271
Waah!

90
00:05:26,687 --> 00:05:27,980
Hello!

91
00:05:28,454 --> 00:05:30,164
H-Hey Anna!

92
00:05:30,655 --> 00:05:32,413
Hey, this is an emergency! Hurry, transform!

93
00:05:32,413 --> 00:05:34,971
Oh no, this is bad!

94
00:05:34,971 --> 00:05:37,788
Sorry for dropping in like this. Is this a bad time?

95
00:05:37,788 --> 00:05:41,439
Nonono! Of course not! You guys are always welcome here!

96
00:05:41,439 --> 00:05:44,161
That's good! What were you up to?

97
00:05:44,161 --> 00:05:46,820
Uh... cleaning the garden?

98
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:48,427
Wow! Can I see?

99
00:05:48,427 --> 00:05:53,363
B-b-b-but Anna! I-It's not done yet!

100
00:05:54,906 --> 00:05:56,960
Why is there a truck in the garden?

101
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:59,699
Uh, someone just asked me to take care of it!

102
00:06:01,622 --> 00:06:05,8
Aah! Hey! Anna!

103
00:06:05,899 --> 00:06:08,65
Why don't we-

104
00:06:11,476 --> 00:06:12,336
Aah!

105
00:06:12,336 --> 00:06:13,990
Shadow X, stealth mode on!

106
00:06:13,990 --> 00:06:17,147
What is it? Why are you doing that?

107
00:06:17,147 --> 00:06:19,277
There was just a huge bug!

108
00:06:19,277 --> 00:06:24,95
Theo, you hate bugs, right? I know!

109
00:06:24,95 --> 00:06:26,655
So Anna, what brings you here?

110
00:06:26,655 --> 00:06:27,699
Oh, that's right!

111
00:06:30,944 --> 00:06:33,507
Now, you can open your eyes...

112
00:06:35,944 --> 00:06:38,6
Happy birthday, Jun!

113
00:06:44,388 --> 00:06:49,854
Thank you, Anna! I never imagined you'd come to celebrate my birthday!

114
00:06:49,854 --> 00:06:52,395
Hey, time to blow out the candles!

115
00:06:54,908 --> 00:06:57,465
Jun. Calling Jun.

116
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:00,396
What's that sound?

117
00:07:00,396 --> 00:07:02,561
Yeah, what's that?

118
00:07:02,561 --> 00:07:05,191
It must be the TV in the living room!

119
00:07:05,191 --> 00:07:09,98
I think we have to open the street now. Will that be okay?

120
00:07:09,98 --> 00:07:10,330
Jun?

121
00:07:10,330 --> 00:07:12,539
Jun! I need a reply!

122
00:07:12,539 --> 00:07:15,538
Jun! Jun! Jun!

123
00:07:15,538 --> 00:07:17,566
Stop saying my name, please!

124
00:07:17,566 --> 00:07:19,437
H-happy birthday, Jun!

125
00:07:19,986 --> 00:07:22,238
Jun! Why isn't he replying?

126
00:07:22,238 --> 00:07:24,269
What? What's the matter?

127
00:07:26,285 --> 00:07:29,402
Maybe he has been taken hostage by robbers!

128
00:07:31,477 --> 00:07:33,464
Jun! I'll be there soon!

129
00:07:34,473 --> 00:07:35,943
Blue Cop!

130
00:07:53,562 --> 00:07:54,902
What was that?

131
00:07:55,32 --> 00:07:57,48
It sounded like an accident!

132
00:07:57,48 --> 00:07:59,212
Anyway, let's blow out the candles!

133
00:07:59,212 --> 00:08:01,225
Yes! Let's sing the birthday song!

134
00:08:01,225 --> 00:08:03,257
1, 2, 3!

135
00:08:03,257 --> 00:08:07,599
Happy birthday to me...

136
00:08:17,987 --> 00:08:19,959
What's that?!

137
00:08:24,367 --> 00:08:26,468
No... this looks really bad!

138
00:08:26,468 --> 00:08:28,581
Don't stand there watching! Give them a hand!

139
00:08:29,721 --> 00:08:32,240
What do we do? Jun! Hurry, give us a command!

140
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:35,652
Jun?!

141
00:08:35,652 --> 00:08:38,806
You're hiding something from me, aren't you?!

142
00:08:38,806 --> 00:08:40,910
But, I...

143
00:08:40,910 --> 00:08:42,179
I'm done!

144
00:08:42,523 --> 00:08:44,561
Ah, no! Anna!

145
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:53,569
Hello...

146
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:57,391
Aah!!

147
00:08:59,345 --> 00:09:01,733
She just found out...

148
00:09:01,733 --> 00:09:03,717
The secret is out...

149
00:09:07,821 --> 00:09:09,000
So you guys are like...

150
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:15,110
refugees who came to Earth all the way from planet Machina at the end of the galaxy?

151
00:09:15,110 --> 00:09:16,673
Oh...

152
00:09:16,673 --> 00:09:18,92
She's smart.

153
00:09:18,286 --> 00:09:21,547
So, Anna. Will you help us keep these guys a secret, please?

154
00:09:21,626 --> 00:09:23,264
I'm afraid not.

155
00:09:23,264 --> 00:09:24,958
Huh? Why not?

156
00:09:24,958 --> 00:09:28,603
Because this is... the first encounter between humanity and aliens.

157
00:09:28,603 --> 00:09:31,555
This is not something us kids can handle by ourselves.

158
00:09:31,555 --> 00:09:32,960
But I'm a grown-up.

159
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:34,460
I'm sorry, Mister Edo.

160
00:09:34,460 --> 00:09:36,831
Wait, please stop calling me Mister...

161
00:09:36,831 --> 00:09:40,261
Anna. We just want to live quietly on planet Earth.

162
00:09:40,261 --> 00:09:41,736
Please trust us.

163
00:09:41,736 --> 00:09:44,235
It's not that I don't trust you. I just think...

164
00:09:44,235 --> 00:09:48,697
that we won't be able to keep lying to the grown ups.

165
00:09:51,278 --> 00:09:52,993
Hey, it's my dad!

166
00:09:53,598 --> 00:09:55,983
Dad? The father of this child!

167
00:09:55,983 --> 00:09:57,884
There are people who are grown-ups?

168
00:09:57,884 --> 00:10:01,7
Anna's dad is the grown-up who is in charge of important things.

169
00:10:01,7 --> 00:10:02,847
He's the mayor of Mowtown!

170
00:10:02,847 --> 00:10:03,939
Shh...

171
00:10:05,684 --> 00:10:07,434
Hello, daddy!

172
00:10:07,885 --> 00:10:10,478
Anna, where are you?

173
00:10:11,92 --> 00:10:13,460
...he's asking where I am!

174
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:15,22
Why is he asking?

175
00:10:15,22 --> 00:10:17,458
Could it be... he found out that you're with us?

176
00:10:17,458 --> 00:10:19,320
No, that's not possible!

177
00:10:19,627 --> 00:10:22,320
He's not a mind reader. How would he know?

178
00:10:22,585 --> 00:10:26,29
No, no! My dad really knows everything!

179
00:10:26,29 --> 00:10:29,400
He knew when I skipped piano practice and when I broke a vase!

180
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:31,595
Yeah! Grown-ups know everything.

181
00:10:31,595 --> 00:10:34,555
Yeah, you can't lie to them, you know.

182
00:10:34,555 --> 00:10:38,300
Hang on! You mean, the mayor already knows?
