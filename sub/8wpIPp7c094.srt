1
00:00:01,524 --> 00:00:04,975
A Metal Cardbot from the Sky!

2
00:00:06,433 --> 00:00:07,997
It's real, I swear!

3
00:00:07,997 --> 00:00:09,790
You may find it hard to believe, but trust me!

4
00:00:09,790 --> 00:00:12,903
All of this is happening in real life!

5
00:00:12,903 --> 00:00:14,653
What is she up to?

6
00:00:14,653 --> 00:00:17,185
It seems Vera's video of Metal Cardbots is blowing up in views.

7
00:00:17,185 --> 00:00:18,807
And overseas!

8
00:00:18,807 --> 00:00:20,561
Overseas?!

9
00:00:20,561 --> 00:00:23,512
Hrgh! I'm filming a report right now, be quiet!

10
00:00:23,512 --> 00:00:24,495
Uh, I'm sorry!

11
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:28,343
What do you mean, "blowing up in views"?

12
00:00:28,343 --> 00:00:31,312
It has already over 5 million views!

13
00:00:31,312 --> 00:00:32,808
Whaat?!

14
00:00:32,808 --> 00:00:35,215
But it seems the comments are divided...

15
00:00:35,853 --> 00:00:37,483
"That's some good CG."

16
00:00:37,483 --> 00:00:39,717
"Just like a Hollywood movie."

17
00:00:39,717 --> 00:00:42,156
"Just a copy of a robot animation."

18
00:00:42,156 --> 00:00:44,107
"Is anyone falling for this prank?"

19
00:00:44,107 --> 00:00:45,623
I'm so mad!

20
00:00:45,623 --> 00:00:48,862
How many times do I have to say this is not a fake video!

21
00:00:48,862 --> 00:00:51,253
I have never used any kind of CGI!

22
00:00:51,253 --> 00:00:55,46
Uh, hey, hang on! Hello?!

23
00:00:55,46 --> 00:00:59,283
It seems she is getting prank calls and harassment from malicious commenters...

24
00:00:59,283 --> 00:01:01,751
I kinda feel bad for her now...

25
00:01:01,751 --> 00:01:04,609
Rrgh! Huh?

26
00:01:04,609 --> 00:01:07,522
Who is this now?

27
00:01:07,522 --> 00:01:11,950
Hello. I am Fleta from Belmeha Island.

28
00:01:11,950 --> 00:01:14,680
I became a fan of yours after seeing your videos.

29
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:17,362
I believe that your videos are real.

30
00:01:17,362 --> 00:01:20,534
I'll be visiting Mowtown tomorrow.

31
00:01:20,534 --> 00:01:22,207
Hope to have a chat with you in person...!

32
00:01:22,207 --> 00:01:25,455
Yes! I know there would be someone out there who believes me!

33
00:01:25,455 --> 00:01:28,875
OMG, I look forward to meeting you, Fleta!

34
00:01:28,875 --> 00:01:30,804
And... I take that back.

35
00:01:30,804 --> 00:01:33,517
She just doesn't give up, does she?

36
00:01:33,517 --> 00:01:35,147
I guess not.

37
00:01:35,926 --> 00:01:38,278
Huh? A friend from overseas?

38
00:01:38,278 --> 00:01:41,31
Said he was a fan of her Metal Cardbot videos.

39
00:01:41,31 --> 00:01:42,615
That doesn't sound good.

40
00:01:42,615 --> 00:01:45,653
I want to keep the Metal Cardbots as secret as possible.

41
00:01:45,653 --> 00:01:48,882
But guys... everyone here already knows, anyway.

42
00:01:48,882 --> 00:01:53,954
I think Crest is already on to us...

43
00:01:53,954 --> 00:01:59,351
Why are you chasing people away?!

44
00:01:59,351 --> 00:02:02,779
Ugh... they saw it with their own eyes!

45
00:02:02,779 --> 00:02:05,124
I don't think we can make up any more excuses...

46
00:02:05,124 --> 00:02:07,412
All of you have been too lax!

47
00:02:07,412 --> 00:02:09,290
We need some special training!

48
00:02:11,216 --> 00:02:12,551
Alright!

49
00:02:12,551 --> 00:02:14,372
You're all here to train to transform into a vehicle mode

50
00:02:14,372 --> 00:02:16,947
or hide before people see you!

51
00:02:16,947 --> 00:02:18,144
We are ready!

52
00:02:18,458 --> 00:02:22,610
Well... get into action as soon as I turn around, okay?

53
00:02:23,65 --> 00:02:25,242
1... 2...

54
00:02:25,242 --> 00:02:26,499
3-go!

55
00:02:29,594 --> 00:02:32,954
Dexter... go in or come out. You have to pick one.

56
00:02:33,332 --> 00:02:35,166
Mega Trucker, I see you!

57
00:02:35,857 --> 00:02:37,835
None of you passed!

58
00:02:39,6 --> 00:02:42,38
Where is Shadow X, though?

59
00:02:42,38 --> 00:02:44,841
You need to be fast, just like m-

60
00:02:44,841 --> 00:02:45,949
Waah!

61
00:02:47,474 --> 00:02:50,427
You could have just used your stealth mode, Shadow X.

62
00:02:50,427 --> 00:02:52,347
You flunk the test too.

63
00:02:59,658 --> 00:03:03,899
First, we need to find who was it that sent Vera the email.

64
00:03:03,899 --> 00:03:08,142
A strange kind of place to... meet a guest from overseas.

65
00:03:08,142 --> 00:03:10,964
Yeah, it's not even a coffee shop. It's a little strange...

66
00:03:13,982 --> 00:03:15,811
Crest is here?!

67
00:03:16,262 --> 00:03:18,207
What are you guys doing here?

68
00:03:18,950 --> 00:03:20,561
Well... we are...

69
00:03:20,561 --> 00:03:23,170
We are... lost, you see?

70
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:26,550
The police officer told us to wait here while he calls our parents!

71
00:03:26,550 --> 00:03:28,82
That is the worst lie ever...

72
00:03:28,82 --> 00:03:29,503
Crest!

73
00:03:29,878 --> 00:03:31,693
Fancy seeing you here!

74
00:03:32,383 --> 00:03:33,482
Hello, Vera.

75
00:03:33,482 --> 00:03:35,537
Wow, that's such a coincidence!

76
00:03:35,537 --> 00:03:37,178
What are you doing here?

77
00:03:37,178 --> 00:03:38,440
They told me you're lost.

78
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:41,177
What?! Our school is right around the corner!

79
00:03:41,177 --> 00:03:44,50
Hehe... uh, anyway,

80
00:03:44,50 --> 00:03:46,733
weren't you meeting the fan who sent you that email?

81
00:03:46,733 --> 00:03:48,804
I guess word spreads fast, huh?

82
00:03:48,804 --> 00:03:50,881
Yeah. We agreed to meet here.

83
00:03:50,881 --> 00:03:52,0
Here?

84
00:03:54,777 --> 00:03:56,263
Looks like he's here!

85
00:04:05,629 --> 00:04:07,93
He arrived in that...?

86
00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:10,253
Careful, Jun! That plane is...

87
00:04:11,821 --> 00:04:13,118
...could it be?

88
00:04:13,118 --> 00:04:14,781
A Metal Cardbot?

89
00:04:17,149 --> 00:04:18,633
Alerting all pedestrians!

90
00:04:18,633 --> 00:04:20,849
Please evacuate the area right now!

91
00:04:33,557 --> 00:04:34,276
Hm.

92
00:04:34,490 --> 00:04:36,659
What? A robot?

93
00:04:39,889 --> 00:04:42,65
Nice to meet you, Vera.

94
00:04:42,65 --> 00:04:44,869
E-excuse me... how do you know my name?!

95
00:04:44,869 --> 00:04:47,217
My name is Fleta Z.

96
00:04:47,217 --> 00:04:48,629
I'm a fan of yours.

97
00:04:48,629 --> 00:04:50,449
Y-You mean...

98
00:04:50,449 --> 00:04:52,757
Is this the guy who sent you the email, Vera?!

99
00:04:52,757 --> 00:04:55,544
The views will be out of this world...

100
00:04:55,544 --> 00:04:56,539
Fleta Z!

101
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:01,813
Stop doing things that alarm the people of this planet!

102
00:05:01,813 --> 00:05:04,566
We've been living among them after losing our home!

103
00:05:04,566 --> 00:05:05,578
B-Blue Cop!

104
00:05:10,504 --> 00:05:14,368
Loitering is not permitted in this area. Please evacuate the area immediately. (FIX_THIS)

105
00:05:14,368 --> 00:05:16,738
Heh, so you think this is hiding?

106
00:05:16,738 --> 00:05:19,825
Blue Cop, what have you done...

107
00:05:21,304 --> 00:05:22,403
Hey, you!

108
00:05:22,403 --> 00:05:23,571
You mean me?

109
00:05:23,571 --> 00:05:25,964
Why did you send the email to Vera?

110
00:05:25,964 --> 00:05:27,856
What is it that you really want?

111
00:05:27,856 --> 00:05:29,680
What do you mean?

112
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:32,908
Like I said earlier... I am her fan.

113
00:05:32,908 --> 00:05:34,797
She is... my hope and light.

114
00:05:34,797 --> 00:05:35,698
A flute?

115
00:05:35,698 --> 00:05:37,360
But it doesn't even have a mouth...?

116
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:39,219
It's a long story.

117
00:05:39,219 --> 00:05:41,43
He even talks while playing the flute...

118
00:05:41,978 --> 00:05:43,879
I crash landed on an island called Belmeha

119
00:05:43,879 --> 00:05:47,13
On the opposite end of the Earth.

120
00:05:47,13 --> 00:05:48,373
Where I landed,

121
00:05:48,373 --> 00:05:52,679
I couldn't sense any Metal Cardbots nearby.

122
00:05:52,679 --> 00:05:56,542
So I was alone, in the depths of the jungle.

123
00:05:56,542 --> 00:05:59,646
Then, one day... a huge turning point arrived.

124
00:05:59,646 --> 00:06:00,894
Turning point?

125
00:06:21,538 --> 00:06:23,310
I was able to find out more about this planet

126
00:06:23,310 --> 00:06:26,59
thanks to the machine they left behind.

127
00:06:26,771 --> 00:06:28,589
...what's this?

128
00:06:28,589 --> 00:06:31,326
That was when I learned...

129
00:06:31,326 --> 00:06:33,411
...that I wasn't alone.

130
00:06:33,411 --> 00:06:37,580
That there were other Metal Cardbots that had landed on this planet.

131
00:06:39,675 --> 00:06:43,503
So you thought that you would be able to find your fellow Metal Cardbots if you met Vera.

132
00:06:43,503 --> 00:06:44,827
Isn't that right?

133
00:06:44,827 --> 00:06:45,722
Yes.

134
00:06:45,722 --> 00:06:47,409
You're very welcome in that case.

135
00:06:47,409 --> 00:06:48,548
Right, Blue Cop?

136
00:06:48,548 --> 00:06:49,445
Yes.

137
00:06:49,445 --> 00:06:54,375
Let's work together to allow the Metal Cardbots and humans to coexist peacefully.

138
00:06:54,375 --> 00:06:55,693
I refuse.

139
00:06:55,693 --> 00:06:57,369
What do you mean?

140
00:06:57,369 --> 00:07:00,45
I wondered by watching these videos...

141
00:07:00,45 --> 00:07:03,244
Why do these Metal Cardbots have to live in hiding?

142
00:07:03,244 --> 00:07:04,371
I told you.

143
00:07:04,371 --> 00:07:06,241
For us Metal Cardbots to live peacefully on this planet-

144
00:07:06,241 --> 00:07:10,283
We need to have some patience?

145
00:07:10,283 --> 00:07:11,521
I'm not buying it.

146
00:07:11,521 --> 00:07:13,961
Why are we the only ones who have to hide?

147
00:07:13,961 --> 00:07:17,703
What exactly is your point here?

148
00:07:17,703 --> 00:07:21,243
You said you wanted humans and Metal Cardbots to coexist.

149
00:07:21,243 --> 00:07:24,341
So we should be able to show ourselves in public

150
00:07:24,341 --> 00:07:26,830
and not have to hide.

151
00:07:26,830 --> 00:07:28,401
I don't want to hide you either...

152
00:07:28,401 --> 00:07:29,360
Jun.

153
00:07:31,530 --> 00:07:32,818
We have no choice.

154
00:07:32,818 --> 00:07:35,695
What if a giant robot just starts walking around town?

155
00:07:35,695 --> 00:07:37,799
That would send people flying into panic!

156
00:07:37,799 --> 00:07:40,722
So we should do it slowly, over time...

157
00:07:40,722 --> 00:07:42,289
So it was you.

158
00:07:42,954 --> 00:07:46,346
The evil boss trying to keep us imprisoned!

159
00:07:46,346 --> 00:07:48,361
W-What do you mean...

160
00:07:51,675 --> 00:07:53,938
Give me the Metal Breath!

161
00:07:53,938 --> 00:07:57,90
If not... I'll take it by force.

162
00:07:57,90 --> 00:07:59,616
H-hey... hang on!

163
00:07:59,616 --> 00:08:00,592
Beak Arrow!

164
00:08:03,710 --> 00:08:04,781
Blue Cop!

165
00:08:05,478 --> 00:08:07,770
It's just a little scratch. It's nothing.

166
00:08:07,770 --> 00:08:10,175
You shouldn't put yourself in danger like that! Come here!

167
00:08:12,622 --> 00:08:14,421
Leave it to me, Jun!

168
00:08:14,421 --> 00:08:16,940
Alright. Thank you, Mega Trucker!

169
00:08:17,732 --> 00:08:19,17
Metal Breath, pickup!

170
00:08:20,990 --> 00:08:22,470
Mega Trucker, setup!

171
00:08:25,553 --> 00:08:29,161
Hey! Big guys like you don't have to cheat like that!

172
00:08:29,161 --> 00:08:31,358
Hm. You have a point.

173
00:08:31,358 --> 00:08:33,343
You can attack first this time.

174
00:08:33,343 --> 00:08:34,342
What?

175
00:08:35,28 --> 00:08:38,141
Mega Trucker, Mega Power Tackle!

176
00:08:38,950 --> 00:08:41,33
Mega Power Tackle!

177
00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:47,879
Are you running away?

178
00:08:48,316 --> 00:08:50,875
I never said I would let it land!

179
00:08:51,745 --> 00:08:54,492
That's nothing to me!

180
00:08:54,492 --> 00:08:57,357
If you think that was all, you are mistaken!

181
00:08:58,141 --> 00:09:00,330
There's no need to even block!

182
00:09:02,877 --> 00:09:04,727
Mega Trucker, behind you!

183
00:09:04,877 --> 00:09:06,49
Huh? What?

184
00:09:09,832 --> 00:09:11,651
You got to stay focused!

185
00:09:12,542 --> 00:09:13,661
Mega Trucker!

186
00:09:14,221 --> 00:09:15,763
It's not safe here.

187
00:09:15,763 --> 00:09:18,40
Let's take Vera somewhere safe!

188
00:09:18,40 --> 00:09:21,513
Looks like the fun has just begun. I'm gonna stay here.

189
00:09:21,513 --> 00:09:23,567
W-What do you mean?!

190
00:09:23,567 --> 00:09:26,716
You know... I want to see what Jun is guarding.

191
00:09:26,716 --> 00:09:28,586
Guarding... what?

192
00:09:29,267 --> 00:09:31,870
Shadow X! Spinning Cutter!

193
00:09:32,465 --> 00:09:34,196
Spinning... Cutter!

194
00:09:42,692 --> 00:09:44,724
Shadow X, go after him!

195
00:09:44,724 --> 00:09:47,267
An aerial battle! It's just my forte!

196
00:09:51,662 --> 00:09:54,444
Looks like you haven't figured out.

197
00:09:54,444 --> 00:09:58,824
I'm vastly superior in every way. Speed, and cruising distance!

198
00:09:58,824 --> 00:09:59,775
What was that?

199
00:09:59,775 --> 00:10:01,211
Waah!

200
00:10:02,761 --> 00:10:05,209
As well as mobility.

201
00:10:05,758 --> 00:10:07,214
Goodbye, then.

202
00:10:09,331 --> 00:10:11,573
Shadow X!

203
00:10:11,573 --> 00:10:13,69
Shadow X, are you alright?

204
00:10:13,69 --> 00:10:15,640
I'm going to get you! Hang in there!

205
00:10:16,30 --> 00:10:17,978
Because of the Metal Breath,

206
00:10:17,978 --> 00:10:20,406
given to the chosen one by the great Deus Machina,

207
00:10:20,406 --> 00:10:27,294
us Metal Cardbots will never have our freedom.

208
00:10:27,294 --> 00:10:27,989
Now.

209
00:10:27,989 --> 00:10:29,432
Please hand over the Metal Breath.

210
00:10:29,712 --> 00:10:31,172
I'll take over this time!

211
00:10:31,172 --> 00:10:32,764
No, I'll do it!

212
00:10:32,764 --> 00:10:38,92
Hold on. You will only become targets if you don't have a strategy against those arrows of light.

213
00:10:38,92 --> 00:10:40,655
Yes. We have to find out...

214
00:10:40,655 --> 00:10:42,639
a way to break his bow!

215
00:10:42,639 --> 00:10:43,995
Now, hurry!

216
00:10:44,395 --> 00:10:47,47
I will never... give it up!

217
00:10:47,47 --> 00:10:48,252
I'm sorry, what?

218
00:10:48,252 --> 00:10:49,543
You heard me!

219
00:10:49,543 --> 00:10:53,258
This is a token of the friendship between me and Blue Cop!

220
00:10:53,258 --> 00:10:53,975
Jun...

221
00:10:54,219 --> 00:10:56,48
I see...

222
00:10:56,48 --> 00:10:57,186
How touching!

223
00:10:57,793 --> 00:10:58,435
Hm.

224
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:01,66
So I see... that's what you want to guard.

225
00:11:02,20 --> 00:11:04,18
Come! Wild Guardy!

226
00:11:04,327 --> 00:11:05,91
Huh?!

227
00:11:11,911 --> 00:11:13,3
Who are you?!

228
00:11:13,3 --> 00:11:14,187
Wild Guardy?

229
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:19,529
What is g...

230
00:11:21,528 --> 00:11:24,343
What is going on now?!
