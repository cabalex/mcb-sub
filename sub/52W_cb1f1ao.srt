1
00:00:01,785 --> 00:00:04,593
The Black Ambulance

2
00:00:06,939 --> 00:00:08,859
A black ambulance?

3
00:00:09,99 --> 00:00:11,704
Yes. An ambulance blackened by fire.

4
00:00:12,70 --> 00:00:17,176
Children taken as its prisoners will have their souls taken by the Grim Reaper,

5
00:00:17,176 --> 00:00:19,578
never to be seen again.

6
00:00:19,578 --> 00:00:21,791
Aah!! I'm so scared!

7
00:00:21,791 --> 00:00:24,546
That's what you want to hear? Try a better story!

8
00:00:24,546 --> 00:00:26,938
Y-yeah, we know it's all made up!

9
00:00:26,938 --> 00:00:28,457
I've heard about it too.

10
00:00:28,457 --> 00:00:34,314
A child was kidnapped by the black ambulance, and by the time he was found...

11
00:00:34,314 --> 00:00:36,434
he had been turned into a mummy!

12
00:00:36,434 --> 00:00:37,635
Aah!

13
00:00:37,635 --> 00:00:40,147
Hey, come on! Stop it already, Anna!

14
00:00:40,147 --> 00:00:42,991
Yeah! Come on, guys! Stop it already!

15
00:00:42,991 --> 00:00:44,589
It's not even a good story!

16
00:00:44,589 --> 00:00:45,842
You WERE listening!

17
00:00:45,842 --> 00:00:48,538
I was just getting to the good part!

18
00:00:48,538 --> 00:00:52,589
No way! You guys seriously need to grow out of those silly stories.

19
00:00:52,589 --> 00:00:53,683
Jun...

20
00:00:53,683 --> 00:00:55,859
Come on... give me a break, Jun!

21
00:00:57,689 --> 00:01:03,180
He used to love stories about robots and ghosts... I wonder what's the matter?

22
00:01:04,815 --> 00:01:06,320
Huh?

23
00:01:07,94 --> 00:01:08,94
...a tire?

24
00:01:11,832 --> 00:01:13,635
Waaugh! Where did it come from??

25
00:01:28,294 --> 00:01:30,961
Hm? What?

26
00:01:30,961 --> 00:01:32,399
T-Teo?

27
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:38,160
Could that be...?!

28
00:01:39,253 --> 00:01:40,203
I'm back!

29
00:01:40,203 --> 00:01:41,549
Hey Jun, what's up?

30
00:01:44,740 --> 00:01:46,46
What's going on?

31
00:01:46,46 --> 00:01:47,782
It's just like a health checkup.

32
00:01:49,925 --> 00:01:51,792
I'm sorry... but I will have to go faster.

33
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:58,35
I don't think so!

34
00:02:03,132 --> 00:02:05,372
That's it, you can stop! Stop!

35
00:02:08,69 --> 00:02:09,964
Blue Cop is in tip-top shape.

36
00:02:10,227 --> 00:02:12,124
I do feel as great as ever.

37
00:02:12,124 --> 00:02:15,87
Mega Trucker, you have a worn out tamper in your knee.

38
00:02:15,87 --> 00:02:16,590
Wait, what?

39
00:02:16,673 --> 00:02:17,936
How can you tell?

40
00:02:17,953 --> 00:02:22,527
Because... after ten years in this job, I can tell a lot just from the sound of things.

41
00:02:22,527 --> 00:02:25,372
What do you mean? I need fixing? No way!

42
00:02:25,372 --> 00:02:29,208
Edo's the best mechanic. You can trust him. Er, well he's not that bad...

43
00:02:29,208 --> 00:02:30,990
Hey, I heard that, Jun.

44
00:02:31,446 --> 00:02:32,848
Jun! Mr. Edo!

45
00:02:33,432 --> 00:02:34,708
Quick, transform!

46
00:02:36,955 --> 00:02:41,99
Aah, what a surprise! What brings you here, Anna?

47
00:02:41,99 --> 00:02:44,352
It's an emergency! Theo has been kidnapped by the black ambulance!

48
00:02:44,352 --> 00:02:45,363
What?

49
00:02:50,221 --> 00:02:51,745
You're the new kid, right?

50
00:02:53,254 --> 00:02:55,573
So... uh, what's your name?

51
00:02:55,573 --> 00:02:56,436
Theo!

52
00:02:56,436 --> 00:02:58,0
Oh, Theo! Hi!

53
00:02:58,0 --> 00:03:01,20
My name's Jun. Come play with us!

54
00:03:01,20 --> 00:03:03,773
But, no... I'm not good at sports...

55
00:03:03,773 --> 00:03:07,968
Don't worry! No one starts out being good at something!

56
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:13,364
You're awake now?

57
00:03:13,756 --> 00:03:15,204
Sorry about that.

58
00:03:15,204 --> 00:03:16,983
My tire slipped off earlier.

59
00:03:16,983 --> 00:03:19,649
A-are you a talking ambulance?

60
00:03:19,649 --> 00:03:22,287
Oh, dear me. I'm sorry.

61
00:03:24,807 --> 00:03:26,702
My name is Mega Ambler.

62
00:03:26,702 --> 00:03:30,15
I'm a Metal Cardbot that looked after patients on Machina planet.

63
00:03:30,15 --> 00:03:32,509
Ma-chi-na Me-tal Card-bot?

64
00:03:32,509 --> 00:03:33,502
Huh?

65
00:03:33,692 --> 00:03:35,866
I saw it with my very own eyes!

66
00:03:35,866 --> 00:03:38,26
The police car turned into a robot!

67
00:03:38,26 --> 00:03:39,731
Could this be...

68
00:03:39,965 --> 00:03:41,712
A black ambulance?

69
00:03:41,712 --> 00:03:43,788
It just sounds like a legend to me!

70
00:03:43,788 --> 00:03:45,661
I saw it with my very own eyes!

71
00:03:45,661 --> 00:03:46,534
Hey, it's Theo...

72
00:03:46,965 --> 00:03:49,660
Huh?! Metal Cardbot!?

73
00:03:49,882 --> 00:03:52,264
What is it? Let me see!

74
00:03:52,264 --> 00:03:54,348
Hey hey! This is private!

75
00:03:54,348 --> 00:03:56,315
You should respect his privacy, Anna!

76
00:03:56,315 --> 00:03:59,126
Don't worry, he was just wondering what I was doing...

77
00:03:59,126 --> 00:04:02,64
Why don't you tell me more about the ambulance over here...

78
00:04:04,149 --> 00:04:05,322
Blue Cop!

79
00:04:09,829 --> 00:04:13,348
I knew I could count on Theo. He even sent a map!

80
00:04:13,348 --> 00:04:16,282
So, your friend is over there... right?

81
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:18,127
Hang in there, Theo...

82
00:04:26,297 --> 00:04:27,764
Jun...

83
00:04:27,864 --> 00:04:30,163
Now, let me have a look at you.

84
00:04:30,163 --> 00:04:31,348
Look... at me...?

85
00:04:31,348 --> 00:04:33,23
Just lie down and stay still.

86
00:04:36,549 --> 00:04:39,403
Hm. The bone seems fine.

87
00:04:39,403 --> 00:04:40,241
Alright, then.

88
00:04:42,803 --> 00:04:44,992
Operation complete.

89
00:04:44,992 --> 00:04:46,95
Now, wrapping it up...

90
00:04:46,997 --> 00:04:48,802
What's going on right now?!

91
00:04:49,387 --> 00:04:50,755
Help me, Jun!

92
00:04:51,293 --> 00:04:53,56
I told you to stay still!

93
00:04:56,493 --> 00:04:57,872
Theo! Are you okay?!

94
00:04:58,136 --> 00:05:00,44
Jun! Get me out of here!

95
00:05:00,44 --> 00:05:00,990
What?

96
00:05:01,33 --> 00:05:03,236
Mega Ambler! Step away from that child!

97
00:05:03,236 --> 00:05:04,786
The police car just t-talked?

98
00:05:04,786 --> 00:05:07,145
Are you also a Metal Cardbot?

99
00:05:08,335 --> 00:05:09,312
What should we do?

100
00:05:09,312 --> 00:05:10,915
Don't you worry about Theo!

101
00:05:10,915 --> 00:05:12,522
Alright.

102
00:05:14,332 --> 00:05:16,147
Are there more robots?

103
00:05:16,248 --> 00:05:17,775
Who are you, then?

104
00:05:17,809 --> 00:05:19,826
Don't you know each other?

105
00:05:19,826 --> 00:05:22,127
Mega Ambler is a notorious travelling doctor.

106
00:05:22,127 --> 00:05:24,251
He goes around treating people without a license,

107
00:05:24,251 --> 00:05:26,602
and charging them exorbitant fees.

108
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:29,486
But you can't deny I've got skill!

109
00:05:31,126 --> 00:05:32,79
Blue Cop!

110
00:05:33,855 --> 00:05:35,335
Looks like you need me again.

111
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:36,448
Mega Trucker?

112
00:05:36,448 --> 00:05:38,471
Don't waste time, just give the command!

113
00:05:45,325 --> 00:05:46,997
Metal Breath, pickup!

114
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:50,488
Mega Trucker, setup!

115
00:06:09,673 --> 00:06:11,43
You stay there!

116
00:06:11,162 --> 00:06:12,298
A-another one?

117
00:06:12,606 --> 00:06:14,228
Theo, you gotta run!

118
00:06:14,228 --> 00:06:16,131
Oh, g-got it!

119
00:06:17,130 --> 00:06:18,467
A new patient?

120
00:06:18,467 --> 00:06:19,625
Mega Trucker,

121
00:06:19,625 --> 00:06:20,899
Mega Power Tackle!

122
00:06:21,639 --> 00:06:23,723
Mega Power Tackle!

123
00:06:26,696 --> 00:06:29,178
Haha, that's not going to work on me!

124
00:06:31,142 --> 00:06:33,982
Now, how did you like that? Mega Trucker power!

125
00:06:34,211 --> 00:06:36,800
That was some power for sure...

126
00:06:37,831 --> 00:06:38,836
...however,

127
00:06:40,719 --> 00:06:42,418
I found your weak spot!

128
00:06:42,418 --> 00:06:43,926
Mega Trucker, watch out!

129
00:06:44,67 --> 00:06:46,53
Huh?

130
00:06:51,972 --> 00:06:53,69
What's going on here...?

131
00:06:53,278 --> 00:06:54,991
You didn't fix yourself properly.

132
00:06:54,991 --> 00:06:57,19
I think you should have listened to Edo...

133
00:07:02,38 --> 00:07:03,138
Are you alright?

134
00:07:03,138 --> 00:07:05,368
Yes. And I am ready to fight!

135
00:07:05,368 --> 00:07:07,983
Got it. Mega Trucker, take back!

136
00:07:07,983 --> 00:07:08,815
H-hold on!

137
00:07:10,607 --> 00:07:11,791
Don't push yourself.

138
00:07:16,63 --> 00:07:17,278
Blue Cop, setup!

139
00:07:38,247 --> 00:07:39,287
Hm?

140
00:07:39,595 --> 00:07:41,594
Broke out of your bandages, I see.

141
00:07:42,68 --> 00:07:44,579
Stop trying to scan me.

142
00:07:44,579 --> 00:07:47,263
I have no weak spots, unlike a certain someone.

143
00:07:47,263 --> 00:07:48,867
Hey, I can hear you!

144
00:07:48,914 --> 00:07:50,116
Looks like it.

145
00:07:50,686 --> 00:07:52,954
But a weak spot can easily be made!

146
00:07:53,428 --> 00:07:55,151
That's not what a doctor does!

147
00:07:55,151 --> 00:07:57,66
Blue Cop, Burst Shot!

148
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:58,426
Burst... Shot!

149
00:08:03,116 --> 00:08:04,831
Forceps Shock!

150
00:08:09,236 --> 00:08:12,267
What's wrong? Should I have a look?

151
00:08:13,916 --> 00:08:15,678
Nothing to see here.

152
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:19,991
Oh no...

153
00:08:21,870 --> 00:08:23,176
This is bad...

154
00:08:23,176 --> 00:08:25,471
Aah! Is your arm alright?

155
00:08:25,484 --> 00:08:27,775
I'll take care of your other arm too!

156
00:08:28,102 --> 00:08:29,235
Blue Cop, watch out!

157
00:08:35,746 --> 00:08:37,703
Blue Cop, can you move your shoulder?

158
00:08:39,308 --> 00:08:41,477
Yeah, I think it's okay.

159
00:08:41,617 --> 00:08:44,645
Alright! I just had an idea.

160
00:08:46,667 --> 00:08:48,678
They caught me off guard...

161
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:53,624
What's happening?

162
00:08:54,445 --> 00:08:55,303
So I just do this?

163
00:08:55,303 --> 00:08:56,346
Just trust me!

164
00:08:57,666 --> 00:08:59,781
I'll make sure you can't move at all!

165
00:09:02,779 --> 00:09:05,674
Now! Megavolt Punch!

166
00:09:06,712 --> 00:09:09,650
Mega...volt...

167
00:09:09,650 --> 00:09:11,62
Punch!!

168
00:09:18,232 --> 00:09:19,624
That's it!

169
00:09:21,237 --> 00:09:24,289
Metal Cardbot... Chain Shot!

170
00:09:42,538 --> 00:09:45,722
Mega Ambler... seal!

171
00:09:52,346 --> 00:09:54,353
Is your arm alright?

172
00:09:54,353 --> 00:09:56,617
I think I'll need a little help from Edo.

173
00:09:56,617 --> 00:09:57,693
Yes.

174
00:09:59,46 --> 00:10:01,22
Theo! Are you okay?

175
00:10:02,567 --> 00:10:06,666
Blue Cop... I can tell Theo, right? He's my best friend...

176
00:10:08,342 --> 00:10:10,370
Of course. If he's your friend.

177
00:10:12,89 --> 00:10:15,500
Theo! There's something you need to know.

178
00:10:19,888 --> 00:10:21,621
How is it?

179
00:10:21,636 --> 00:10:23,756
I couldn't be better!

180
00:10:24,397 --> 00:10:25,516
And Blue Cop?

181
00:10:25,516 --> 00:10:27,430
As good as new.

182
00:10:27,804 --> 00:10:29,906
We have this one all cleaned up, too.

183
00:10:31,353 --> 00:10:33,110
I think it's finally ready now.

184
00:10:38,449 --> 00:10:40,469
Theo. I have a favor to ask.

185
00:10:40,469 --> 00:10:45,404
Hey, don't worry! I won't tell anyone about the Metal Cardbots. I promise!

186
00:10:45,404 --> 00:10:48,21
I'm sorry I startled you earlier.
