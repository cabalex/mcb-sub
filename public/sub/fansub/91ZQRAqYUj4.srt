1
00:01:11,337 --> 00:01:13,857
Wild Cardbot's Roar

2
00:01:17,708 --> 00:01:20,204
Blue Cop! What happened to your arm...?!

3
00:01:27,173 --> 00:01:29,375
Tch! Those noisy jerks are back!

4
00:01:30,305 --> 00:01:31,094
Get back here!

5
00:01:31,094 --> 00:01:31,954
Are you okay, Blue Cop?

6
00:01:33,070 --> 00:01:34,263
Wha- Blue Cop!

7
00:01:34,263 --> 00:01:35,863
That's... it can't be!

8
00:01:38,597 --> 00:01:40,534
Everyone... Get away from me!

9
00:01:40,534 --> 00:01:41,759
Blue Cop! Take Ba-

10
00:01:43,547 --> 00:01:45,279
Blue Cop! Can't you recognize us?!

11
00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:47,238
I do! But...!!

12
00:01:47,974 --> 00:01:50,928
He started acting like that after he was attacked by that helicopter bot!

13
00:01:51,528 --> 00:01:53,493
This must be the "Beast Virus"!

14
00:01:53,493 --> 00:01:54,492
Beast Virus?!

15
00:01:54,492 --> 00:01:58,396
It's a terrifying disease that turns infected Metal Cardbots into vicious beasts. 

16
00:01:58,396 --> 00:02:00,272
If left untreated, Blue Cop's life will be in danger!

17
00:02:00,272 --> 00:02:00,908
What?!

18
00:02:04,409 --> 00:02:05,589
Wake up, Blue Cop!

19
00:02:07,181 --> 00:02:08,693
Phoenix Fire! Set Up!

20
00:02:16,337 --> 00:02:17,216
Mega Ambler!

21
00:02:24,717 --> 00:02:27,532
Please stop it, Blue Cop! We're your friends!

22
00:02:27,532 --> 00:02:28,398
Shut up.

23
00:02:29,198 --> 00:02:31,176
I don't have any... 

24
00:02:33,185 --> 00:02:34,153
FRIENDS!!

25
00:02:34,153 --> 00:02:34,958
Blue Cop!

26
00:02:47,687 --> 00:02:48,307
Who...

27
00:02:48,307 --> 00:02:48,892
Shh.

28
00:02:50,639 --> 00:02:52,418
It's okay. You can relax.

29
00:02:53,592 --> 00:02:56,780
Don't worry. No one is going to hurt you.

30
00:03:14,089 --> 00:03:15,189
Sealing complete.

31
00:03:16,241 --> 00:03:17,937
Wait! He's my dearest-

32
00:03:22,497 --> 00:03:24,749
...dearest friend. Right?

33
00:03:24,849 --> 00:03:26,511
Y-yeah.

34
00:03:26,896 --> 00:03:27,587
Huh?!

35
00:03:28,690 --> 00:03:29,804
Hey, kid! Wake up!

36
00:03:35,423 --> 00:03:37,856
Do not lay a single finger on Soleil.

37
00:03:37,856 --> 00:03:39,061
Soleil?

38
00:03:39,061 --> 00:03:40,497
Is that the name of this child?

39
00:03:40,997 --> 00:03:42,161
And just who are you?!

40
00:03:42,801 --> 00:03:44,520
I am... Blaion.

41
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:49,675
Blaion...

42
00:03:57,305 --> 00:04:00,296
Uncle Edo, how's Blue Cop holding up?

43
00:04:00,296 --> 00:04:03,355
His appearance changed a bit, but he seems to be fine.

44
00:04:04,852 --> 00:04:05,704
Jun!

45
00:04:05,704 --> 00:04:07,430
Why am I in the car center?

46
00:04:07,430 --> 00:04:08,756
What happened?!

47
00:04:08,756 --> 00:04:10,441
Huh? You don't remember anything?

48
00:04:10,441 --> 00:04:12,599
Looks like he completely forgot what happened last night.

49
00:04:12,599 --> 00:04:14,827
He might be better off not knowing.

50
00:04:14,827 --> 00:04:16,029
Hey...

51
00:04:16,029 --> 00:04:19,032
Do you at least remember that I lent you money so that you could buy a book?

52
00:04:19,032 --> 00:04:20,681
Wait, really? H-how much was it?

53
00:04:20,681 --> 00:04:21,532
Just kidding!

54
00:04:21,532 --> 00:04:22,060
What??

55
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:24,522
Falling for such an obvious trick? You're still so gullible.

56
00:04:24,522 --> 00:04:26,061
Do you think this is funny?!

57
00:04:26,061 --> 00:04:27,125
Mr. Mayor!

58
00:04:27,125 --> 00:04:31,379
I had accepted you all because I believed that humans and Metal Cardbots could coexist! 

59
00:04:31,379 --> 00:04:34,400
What do you think will happen to my reputation when you cause a disturbance in the streets, like you did yesterday?!

60
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,672
I'm sorry.

61
00:04:35,972 --> 00:04:39,048
Both of the troublemakers were bots we've never seen before.

62
00:04:39,048 --> 00:04:40,843
Perhaps they're acting like that because

63
00:04:40,843 --> 00:04:43,638
they haven't been on Earth very long and don't know the rules yet.

64
00:04:43,638 --> 00:04:46,876
I do not care. There will be a mayoral election next year!

65
00:04:46,876 --> 00:04:49,714
If my approval ratings drop any further because of you, I will be in-

66
00:04:49,714 --> 00:04:50,574
DAD.

67
00:04:50,574 --> 00:04:52,946
A-ahem! Excuse me.

68
00:04:52,946 --> 00:04:56,718
Anyways, find that helicopter and fire engine as soon as possible.

69
00:04:56,718 --> 00:04:58,319
Sorry. My dad is being so...

70
00:04:58,319 --> 00:04:59,944
Don't worry about it, Anna.

71
00:04:59,944 --> 00:05:03,568
Creating a society where everyone can live together is our goal and responsibility.

72
00:05:03,568 --> 00:05:06,685
About that. I want to speak to all of you about last night.

73
00:05:07,977 --> 00:05:09,666
Is that... a Weapon Card?

74
00:05:09,666 --> 00:05:13,787
Yes. Blue Cop's Weapon Card. It wasn't just him whose appearance has changed.

75
00:05:13,787 --> 00:05:17,508
My analysis shows that the Beast Virus that corrupted Blue Cop has been contained inside it.

76
00:05:17,508 --> 00:05:19,836
By the way, what is the Beast Virus?

77
00:05:19,836 --> 00:05:22,879
It's a pathogen that Wild Cardbots carry from creation.

78
00:05:22,879 --> 00:05:24,057
"Wild Cardbots"?

79
00:05:24,057 --> 00:05:25,756
First I've heard of them.

80
00:05:25,756 --> 00:05:28,645
Since ancient times, there has been a force on planet Machina...

81
00:05:28,645 --> 00:05:31,534
that's been hostile towards the Metal Cardbots.

82
00:05:31,534 --> 00:05:35,457
They are called the Wild Cardbots, wielding the power of the beasts.

83
00:05:35,457 --> 00:05:40,394
They were a fearsome species that raided our cities and wreaked all manner of destruction. 

84
00:05:40,394 --> 00:05:43,217
To counter the threat of the Wild Cardbots' uprising,

85
00:05:43,217 --> 00:05:46,841
Deus Machina formed an elite unit of Metal Cardbots.

86
00:05:47,348 --> 00:05:49,094
Wait. You must mean...

87
00:05:49,094 --> 00:05:50,069
That's right.

88
00:05:50,069 --> 00:05:51,844
They were the Star Guardians.

89
00:05:53,344 --> 00:05:57,174
Though, with the destruction of planet Machina, all that fighting has become meaningless.

90
00:05:57,174 --> 00:06:01,489
As I suspected, Wild Cardbots, too, somehow survived and came to Earth.

91
00:06:01,489 --> 00:06:04,506
The helicopter and that Blaion guy must be one of them, right?

92
00:06:04,506 --> 00:06:06,861
The way they summoned their Weapon Cards, and those eyes...

93
00:06:06,861 --> 00:06:08,216
There's no doubting it.

94
00:06:08,216 --> 00:06:12,036
The Beast Virus is a pathogen that infects the electronic neural circuits of Metal Cardbots. 

95
00:06:12,036 --> 00:06:15,235
To prevent infection, we must eradicate the Wild Cardbots as soon as possible.

96
00:06:15,235 --> 00:06:16,058
Eradicate?!

97
00:06:16,058 --> 00:06:17,180
Not sealing?!

98
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:19,972
Hey hey hey, you're taking this too far!

99
00:06:19,972 --> 00:06:23,198
I'm being serious. This is a warning from a doctor.

100
00:06:23,698 --> 00:06:24,836
An unlicensed doctor.

101
00:06:24,836 --> 00:06:26,472
They are a dangerous species!

102
00:06:27,172 --> 00:06:28,856
Or are they?

103
00:06:28,856 --> 00:06:29,984
What are you thinking?

104
00:06:29,984 --> 00:06:33,889
There was this girl named Soleil who stopped you from going berserk yesterday.

105
00:06:33,889 --> 00:06:35,994
And she had a Metal Breath too.

106
00:06:35,994 --> 00:06:36,954
WHAT?!

107
00:06:36,954 --> 00:06:38,826
That can't be! Are you sure, Jun?

108
00:06:38,826 --> 00:06:41,709
Yep! But it looked different from Peruru's and mine.

109
00:06:41,709 --> 00:06:45,037
Only the chosen ones can wield the Metal Breath, right?

110
00:06:45,037 --> 00:06:48,807
The treasures of Deus Machina should not appear so often, one after another.

111
00:06:48,807 --> 00:06:49,776
This is hard to wrap my head around...

112
00:06:49,776 --> 00:06:52,726
That's why we need to hear her side of the story!

113
00:06:52,726 --> 00:06:55,146
That may be true, but how do we find her?

114
00:06:55,146 --> 00:06:57,714
The population of Motown is about 7 million, ya know.

115
00:06:57,714 --> 00:06:59,414
It'll be like looking for a needle in a desert.

116
00:06:59,414 --> 00:07:03,219
Hey, hold up! What are we going to do about the helicopter spreading the virus?!

117
00:07:03,219 --> 00:07:05,263
Heh heh... Don't you worry about that, Anna.

118
00:07:05,263 --> 00:07:08,906
I'm always three steps ahead!

119
00:07:08,906 --> 00:07:10,278
...But first I need to call the Mayor.

120
00:07:19,627 --> 00:07:21,739
So you're awake, Soleil.

121
00:07:21,739 --> 00:07:24,450
Goodness... Why did you do something so reckless?

122
00:07:24,650 --> 00:07:29,722
My mother told me that because I am a strong girl, I should be helping those in need.

123
00:07:29,722 --> 00:07:32,766
Still, you didn't have to put yourself in danger like that.

124
00:07:32,766 --> 00:07:34,422
You and I just have a difference in mindset.

125
00:07:34,822 --> 00:07:36,225
Ahh, ahhhh...

126
00:07:36,225 --> 00:07:39,028
Is this thing on now? Ah, okay, okay.

127
00:07:39,028 --> 00:07:41,283
Ah, this is a summons.

128
00:07:41,283 --> 00:07:45,610
Ms. Soleil, who is with Blaion, please come to warehouse 003 at the port of Mowtown immediately.

129
00:07:45,610 --> 00:07:48,137
I have something to deliver to you.

130
00:07:48,737 --> 00:07:50,170
Who the heck would summon-

131
00:07:50,170 --> 00:07:51,639
It's Jun. Probably.

132
00:07:51,639 --> 00:07:54,843
Is he stupid? This channel is for Mowtown's disaster prevention announcements!

133
00:07:54,843 --> 00:07:57,891
You're the stupid one. You're the one who called me by name in front of them.

134
00:07:57,891 --> 00:07:59,115
Uh, ahem...

135
00:07:59,115 --> 00:08:01,597
Since they're calling for us, why don't we go see what they want?

136
00:08:01,597 --> 00:08:02,492
Are you being serious?

137
00:08:02,492 --> 00:08:05,508
Or would you like me to go there alone again?

138
00:08:05,508 --> 00:08:07,687
Ugh... Fine, fine.

139
00:08:09,387 --> 00:08:10,210
Hmm...

140
00:08:10,210 --> 00:08:14,834
I think I understood the plan, but do you really think they'd come all the way out here just because you called for them?

141
00:08:14,834 --> 00:08:16,382
Of course they will.

142
00:08:16,382 --> 00:08:18,731
Guys! When Blaion appears, proceed as planned!

143
00:08:18,731 --> 00:08:19,358
Roger!

144
00:08:19,358 --> 00:08:20,086
You can count on us.

145
00:08:20,697 --> 00:08:24,295
And here I am again, going along with Jun's reckless plans every time...

146
00:08:24,295 --> 00:08:25,139
Uhhh...

147
00:08:25,139 --> 00:08:26,784
Hey! They really came!

148
00:08:31,190 --> 00:08:32,390
You must be Blaion?

149
00:08:32,390 --> 00:08:36,052
Welcome! I knew you would come.

150
00:08:36,052 --> 00:08:39,058
This is quite the audience for a simple handover.

151
00:08:39,058 --> 00:08:40,264
What's the real reason you called us out here?

152
00:08:40,264 --> 00:08:42,008
Haha! You'll find out soon enough.

153
00:08:42,008 --> 00:08:42,774
Now!

154
00:08:48,656 --> 00:08:49,556
Bzzzt!! 

155
00:08:50,356 --> 00:08:51,368
Too loud!!

156
00:08:52,098 --> 00:08:53,310
Phantom Hornet?!

157
00:08:53,310 --> 00:08:54,066
Bingo!

158
00:08:54,066 --> 00:08:57,327
Tch. I thought I'd finally found a place to settle down!

159
00:08:57,527 --> 00:08:59,866
I'm sorry, but we need you to come with us!

160
00:08:59,866 --> 00:09:01,753
I'll fix that awful temper for you!

161
00:09:02,053 --> 00:09:03,624
What are they doing here?!

162
00:09:03,624 --> 00:09:05,079
Hehehe! You wanna know?

163
00:09:05,079 --> 00:09:09,607
There are CCTV cameras for monitoring traffic throughout Mowtown's roads,

164
00:09:09,607 --> 00:09:11,735
so we used them to roughly track them down.

165
00:09:11,735 --> 00:09:15,949
They must've noticed the cameras and flown through the canal instead of on the road...

166
00:09:15,949 --> 00:09:18,148
...But unfortunately for them, there were witnesses.

167
00:09:24,046 --> 00:09:26,362
Bzzt! Those pesky little things!

168
00:09:26,962 --> 00:09:28,415
You're not getting away this time!

169
00:09:30,621 --> 00:09:33,112
Where are you going? The diagnosis hasn't even started yet!

170
00:09:33,112 --> 00:09:34,603
Are doctors really that scary?

171
00:09:36,303 --> 00:09:37,709
Why did you call us here?

172
00:09:37,709 --> 00:09:38,656
Why do you think?

173
00:09:38,656 --> 00:09:40,114
Because we trust you.

174
00:09:40,114 --> 00:09:41,400
You trust us?

175
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:45,812
Yes. You helped us in our moment of need, even though we were strangers.

176
00:09:45,812 --> 00:09:47,425
That means you're not our enemies.

177
00:09:49,225 --> 00:09:52,139
Bzzt! I would've spared you if you just left me alone!

178
00:09:53,949 --> 00:09:54,694
Watch out!

179
00:09:58,517 --> 00:09:59,570
Looks like we were right.

180
00:10:00,317 --> 00:10:03,176
Hmph! Just catch them already.

181
00:10:05,292 --> 00:10:08,250
I'll make you regret chasing after me!

182
00:10:09,285 --> 00:10:10,234
Let's do this!

183
00:10:21,151 --> 00:10:22,298
The Metal Breath...!

184
00:10:22,298 --> 00:10:23,383
Don't worry.

185
00:10:23,383 --> 00:10:27,469
It's simply taken a form that suits your friend's new wild powers.

186
00:10:28,269 --> 00:10:30,648
Alright! Blue Cop! Are you ready?

187
00:10:30,648 --> 00:10:31,432
I always am!

188
00:10:32,761 --> 00:10:34,278
Blue Cop Wild! Set up!

189
00:10:49,863 --> 00:10:50,929
Huh? Wait!

190
00:10:50,929 --> 00:10:52,994
I thought I struck you with my poisonous stinger!

191
00:10:52,994 --> 00:10:55,575
I don't know much about that so-called Beast Virus...

192
00:10:55,575 --> 00:10:58,355
But we'll show you that we're no pushovers!

193
00:10:58,755 --> 00:11:03,574
Bzzt! You should've just accepted the change! Phantom Legion!!

194
00:11:04,204 --> 00:11:05,754
These are advanced holographic clones!

195
00:11:05,754 --> 00:11:08,073
No problem! Blue Cop! Burst Gun!

196
00:11:13,593 --> 00:11:14,887
Found them! Go!

197
00:11:17,852 --> 00:11:19,147
Venospear!

198
00:11:27,430 --> 00:11:28,385
Watch your five!

199
00:11:38,929 --> 00:11:40,328
Alpha Bolt Cannon!

200
00:11:41,256 --> 00:11:43,078
Infernal Stinger!

201
00:11:43,434 --> 00:11:45,276
Alpha Bolt Cannon!

202
00:11:50,752 --> 00:11:51,358
Now!

203
00:11:59,790 --> 00:12:02,710
Thunder Howl! Smaaash!!

204
00:12:02,838 --> 00:12:06,463
Thunder Howl... Smash!!

205
00:12:14,849 --> 00:12:16,040
Way to go!

206
00:12:24,734 --> 00:12:26,089
Wild Cardbot! Change Up!

207
00:12:26,089 --> 00:12:26,672
Step aside.

208
00:12:27,272 --> 00:12:27,793
Eh?

209
00:12:35,666 --> 00:12:37,171
Phantom Hornet, sealed.

210
00:12:37,842 --> 00:12:39,266
Soleil...?

211
00:12:39,266 --> 00:12:41,474
I'll be taking them with me.
