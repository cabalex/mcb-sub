1
00:00:02,180 --> 00:00:05,137
Can't Stop!

2
00:00:08,907 --> 00:00:10,846
At this hour?

3
00:00:12,194 --> 00:00:14,667
"Good morning Peruru."

4
00:00:15,268 --> 00:00:17,564
Do you even know what time it is over here-

5
00:00:17,564 --> 00:00:18,259
Huh?!

6
00:00:18,859 --> 00:00:22,925
"Have you eaten your breakfast?" It's night here!

7
00:00:22,925 --> 00:00:24,322
"Have you brushed your teeth?"

8
00:00:24,322 --> 00:00:25,771
"You should exercise regularly."

9
00:00:25,771 --> 00:00:27,895
"How about your homework?"... Homework?! 

10
00:00:27,895 --> 00:00:32,720
Who cares about homework?! I'm trying to carry on Mukara's will!

11
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:35,886
But the stone tablets and the Metal Breath are all...!

12
00:00:37,169 --> 00:00:39,444
"Don't push yourself too hard."

13
00:00:40,392 --> 00:00:45,548
Mom... I don't know what to do anymore...

14
00:00:46,30 --> 00:00:53,375
What?! Your memory card is missing?! How many times will you repeat these same mistakes over and over again?!

15
00:00:53,375 --> 00:00:58,225
But I really got it this time! A robot turned into a semi truck and-

16
00:00:58,225 --> 00:01:00,954
Forget it! Get out of my sight!

17
00:01:04,269 --> 00:01:09,382
So you're saying... You accidentally picked up a memory card lying in the park?

18
00:01:09,382 --> 00:01:11,272
Yeah! Accidentally.

19
00:01:11,272 --> 00:01:14,453
Just because you found an abandoned item, doesn't mean you own it.

20
00:01:14,453 --> 00:01:17,424
I'll return it as soon as I find out who the owner is.

21
00:01:17,424 --> 00:01:18,396
Oops...

22
00:01:18,396 --> 00:01:21,375
You seem troubled today. Is something wrong?

23
00:01:21,375 --> 00:01:23,551
Huh? N-no. It's nothing...

24
00:01:23,551 --> 00:01:27,332
In that case! Shall we take a look at what's on this memory card?

25
00:01:33,60 --> 00:01:35,60
Has he been like that this whole time?

26
00:01:35,60 --> 00:01:37,490
Yep. Looks like he still needs some time alone.

27
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:42,380
I'll check the files now.

28
00:01:43,783 --> 00:01:46,734
We can't let these pictures reach the public...

29
00:01:46,734 --> 00:01:49,80
Looks like the card can't be returned to the owner.

30
00:01:49,80 --> 00:01:51,813
Wait, stop. Where did that wound come from?

31
00:01:51,813 --> 00:01:53,495
I kept wondering about that too.

32
00:01:53,495 --> 00:01:56,759
Did he get hit by something? Or... bitten by someone?

33
00:01:56,759 --> 00:01:58,145
Bitten? No way.

34
00:01:58,145 --> 00:02:00,114
Think you can fix that, Uncle Edo?

35
00:02:00,114 --> 00:02:02,842
Hmm, I can't do much for this kind of wound. 

36
00:02:02,842 --> 00:02:08,570
The only options are to replace it with a new part entirely, or remove the damaged part and have it processed with an alloy.

37
00:02:08,570 --> 00:02:09,900
NO!!

38
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:10,659
That scared me!

39
00:02:10,659 --> 00:02:12,632
When did he get here?!

40
00:02:12,632 --> 00:02:13,692
Where are you going?

41
00:02:13,692 --> 00:02:16,293
Isn't it obvious?! I'm gonna go find my dad!

42
00:02:16,293 --> 00:02:18,194
We don't have any clues on where to find him!

43
00:02:18,194 --> 00:02:19,942
So you want me to sit still and do nothing?!

44
00:02:19,942 --> 00:02:24,288
Dad kept saying that his head hurts! I gotta' hurry and give him some first aid!

45
00:02:24,288 --> 00:02:26,350
Hey! Why did you have to break that door?!

46
00:02:26,350 --> 00:02:28,837
I'm gonna find my dad!!

47
00:02:29,978 --> 00:02:31,563
What is this stench?!

48
00:02:31,563 --> 00:02:33,296
That's one nasty fart!

49
00:02:33,596 --> 00:02:36,889
I'm coming to save you! Daaaaaad!!

50
00:02:37,645 --> 00:02:38,765
Daaaaaad!

51
00:02:38,865 --> 00:02:39,896
Dad!

52
00:02:41,268 --> 00:02:44,210
Man, it's just a bunch of cars that look like my dad...

53
00:02:44,210 --> 00:02:45,131
Huh?

54
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:48,581
DAD! Red Blitz is here!

55
00:02:48,581 --> 00:02:50,856
...oh, it wasn't him.

56
00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:54,591
Hey! You're the thief who stole my kite!

57
00:02:54,591 --> 00:02:55,677
Kite?

58
00:02:57,268 --> 00:02:58,278
You're...

59
00:02:58,677 --> 00:03:02,562
Hey there, kid! Nice kite you got there!

60
00:03:05,905 --> 00:03:08,504
Wait, you're that kid from the park.

61
00:03:08,504 --> 00:03:09,641
Give me back my kite!

62
00:03:09,641 --> 00:03:14,912
You little runt. You have some nerve in your engine, picking a fight with me!

63
00:03:14,912 --> 00:03:15,990
Shut up!

64
00:03:16,627 --> 00:03:20,560
You have some nerve in your engine, picking a fight with my captain.

65
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:24,771
Shut up! I'm gonna crush you all for sure!

66
00:03:24,771 --> 00:03:29,956
That's right. You won't back down just because you heard something like that. Heh...

67
00:03:29,956 --> 00:03:33,304
Your kite is broken so I can't give it back to ya. Sorry.

68
00:03:33,304 --> 00:03:37,432
Instead, how 'bout driving with me? Does that sound good to you?

69
00:03:37,432 --> 00:03:38,454
Really?!

70
00:03:38,817 --> 00:03:40,133
Woah!

71
00:03:40,133 --> 00:03:41,167
Whaddya' think?

72
00:03:41,167 --> 00:03:42,997
Super cool!

73
00:03:42,997 --> 00:03:44,675
By the way, what's your name?

74
00:03:44,975 --> 00:03:45,810
Kent!

75
00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:48,105
Why aren't you playing with the other kids?

76
00:03:48,105 --> 00:03:51,375
'Cause they're boring. They always cry for no reason!

77
00:03:51,375 --> 00:03:52,643
You don't cry?

78
00:03:52,835 --> 00:03:54,599
I don't cry!

79
00:03:54,599 --> 00:03:55,968
You wanna bet on that?

80
00:03:55,968 --> 00:03:56,836
What?

81
00:04:01,772 --> 00:04:02,915
Well? Scared yet?

82
00:04:02,915 --> 00:04:05,840
T-this isn't scary at all!

83
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:07,381
Then how about this?!

84
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:10,129
You can cry if you're scared!

85
00:04:10,129 --> 00:04:12,539
I said I don't cry!

86
00:04:13,276 --> 00:04:15,342
You're such a stubborn little kid!

87
00:04:18,322 --> 00:04:20,677
He sure kicked the door off clean.

88
00:04:22,432 --> 00:04:25,252
That should be enough, right?

89
00:04:25,252 --> 00:04:27,137
That smelled horrible.

90
00:04:27,137 --> 00:04:28,738
My arms hurt...

91
00:04:28,738 --> 00:04:30,129
We're done with ventilation!

92
00:04:30,129 --> 00:04:30,855
Great work.

93
00:04:30,855 --> 00:04:31,396
Thanks.

94
00:04:31,396 --> 00:04:34,750
What kind of fuel has he been eating these days?

95
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:35,975
I'm dizzy...

96
00:04:35,975 --> 00:04:38,965
Could it be an engine problem?

97
00:04:38,965 --> 00:04:39,937
Engine problem?

98
00:04:39,937 --> 00:04:41,830
I'll have to take a look at his engine to find out what the problem is.

99
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:44,876
But if it's severe, his engine compartment could catch fire,

100
00:04:44,876 --> 00:04:47,923
or it could run wild, causing the brakes to become unresponsive.

101
00:04:47,923 --> 00:04:49,668
That would be a big problem!

102
00:04:49,668 --> 00:04:53,720
Looks like we have to go find Red Blitz before Gigantrex.

103
00:04:55,129 --> 00:04:58,867
Huh? Bad timing, mom! Sorry, keep talking.

104
00:04:58,867 --> 00:05:00,762
It's okay. Go check on it.

105
00:05:00,762 --> 00:05:03,762
It's nothing. Just another pointless, daily life photo-

106
00:05:03,762 --> 00:05:04,728
Photos?

107
00:05:04,728 --> 00:05:06,120
I wanna see your mom, Peruru!

108
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:06,863
Let us see her too!

109
00:05:06,963 --> 00:05:09,456
T-There's really nothing to look at!

110
00:05:09,918 --> 00:05:12,519
"Good night." It's daytime here!

111
00:05:12,519 --> 00:05:15,365
That's your mom? She looks amazing!

112
00:05:15,365 --> 00:05:17,550
Pahahaha! You look nothing like her!

113
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:19,317
It's rude to laugh, Jun.

114
00:05:19,317 --> 00:05:21,207
Looks like you haven't replied to her messages.

115
00:05:21,207 --> 00:05:23,882
My parents only know how to nag me.

116
00:05:23,882 --> 00:05:27,156
"Did you do your homework?" "Are you brushing your teeth twice every day?"

117
00:05:27,156 --> 00:05:28,540
I understand...

118
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:31,240
It's natural for parents to worry about their children.

119
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:33,904
Eh? But you're not married!

120
00:05:33,904 --> 00:05:35,829
And you don't even have a girlfriend!

121
00:05:35,829 --> 00:05:36,759
So how would you know?

122
00:05:36,759 --> 00:05:37,738
Is that the only reason?

123
00:05:37,738 --> 00:05:38,494
What?

124
00:05:38,494 --> 00:05:40,815
Are there other reasons why you might be avoiding your parents?

125
00:05:41,415 --> 00:05:44,418
I need to return to my village with all four stone tablets.

126
00:05:44,418 --> 00:05:50,822
But all of them got unsealed and became Metal Cardbots, and the Metal Breath now belongs to Jun. 

127
00:05:50,822 --> 00:05:56,237
I don't know what to say to my parents. I don't even know what I should do anymore.

128
00:05:58,519 --> 00:05:59,209
It must be rough...

129
00:05:59,209 --> 00:06:00,584
I'm fine.

130
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:04,285
Mom's calling again...

131
00:06:04,285 --> 00:06:07,282
What is it, Mom? The temple...

132
00:06:07,282 --> 00:06:10,379
What?! The mural is suddenly glowing?!

133
00:06:17,353 --> 00:06:21,156
I drove that fast and you're still not crying? You got some guts!

134
00:06:21,156 --> 00:06:22,269
Let's do it again!

135
00:06:22,269 --> 00:06:24,207
Heh, you got it!

136
00:06:26,331 --> 00:06:28,800
W-what's happening?!

137
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:29,336
What's wrong?

138
00:06:31,819 --> 00:06:33,446
My engine is out of control! 

139
00:06:33,745 --> 00:06:36,593
My brakes... aren't working!!

140
00:06:37,158 --> 00:06:41,454
Now, let's cross the road two by two. 2, 4, 6, 8...

141
00:06:41,454 --> 00:06:43,151
Huh? One of you are missing.

142
00:06:43,151 --> 00:06:45,120
Ms. Mona!

143
00:06:45,536 --> 00:06:47,814
Help meeeee!

144
00:06:48,582 --> 00:06:49,877
Kent!

145
00:06:49,877 --> 00:06:52,209
Wow! Kent is so fast!

146
00:06:52,209 --> 00:06:53,975
What's going on?

147
00:06:53,975 --> 00:06:57,737
I don't know! Nothing like this has ever happened before.

148
00:06:57,737 --> 00:07:01,860
Could Mukara be telling us to clean the spear until it's sparkly clean?

149
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:04,786
Your innocence is definitely your charm, Rock Crush.

150
00:07:04,786 --> 00:07:05,968
Really?

151
00:07:07,848 --> 00:07:11,557
Ms. Mona? Hello! What seems to be the problem? 

152
00:07:11,557 --> 00:07:13,559
- He just can't hide his excitement.
- Yes, ah, what?

153
00:07:13,559 --> 00:07:17,505
G-guys? She said that a red sports car kidnapped a boy.

154
00:07:17,505 --> 00:07:18,889
RED BLITZ!

155
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:25,589
Hold on! I'll find a way to-

156
00:07:25,589 --> 00:07:27,709
Red Blitz! I knew it was you!

157
00:07:27,709 --> 00:07:30,216
You! What took you so long?!

158
00:07:30,216 --> 00:07:32,606
What? We heard that you kidnapped a boy-

159
00:07:32,606 --> 00:07:34,377
You think I'd do something like that?! I wouldn't, right?!

160
00:07:34,377 --> 00:07:35,269
R-right!

161
00:07:35,269 --> 00:07:38,617
Anyway, my engine is running wild and I can't stop it!

162
00:07:38,617 --> 00:07:40,765
Help us PLEAAASE!!

163
00:07:41,566 --> 00:07:43,399
Blue Cop, follow them closely for now!

164
00:07:43,399 --> 00:07:44,365
Roger!

165
00:07:44,365 --> 00:07:46,576
Cielo! Can you grab them from up there?

166
00:07:46,576 --> 00:07:49,343
It won't be easy to approach because of these wires.

167
00:07:50,99 --> 00:07:52,264
So we have no choice but to go with plan B, then?

168
00:07:52,264 --> 00:07:56,360
We should save the kid first! Blue Cop, get as close to Red Blitz as you can!

169
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:57,646
You sure you want to do this?

170
00:07:57,646 --> 00:08:00,800
Of course! Don't you trust my athletic ability?

171
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,612
Alright. Then I'll leave this to you! Blue Cop!

172
00:08:02,612 --> 00:08:03,851
Hang on tight!

173
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:07,365
You can do that?

174
00:08:07,365 --> 00:08:08,468
Wh-what?!

175
00:08:08,783 --> 00:08:10,319
Okay! I'm ready!

176
00:08:10,331 --> 00:08:11,339
Roger!

177
00:08:12,226 --> 00:08:14,178
Carefully, carefully...!

178
00:08:14,824 --> 00:08:15,524
Watch out!

179
00:08:15,524 --> 00:08:16,687
NOT AGAIN!

180
00:08:16,687 --> 00:08:20,783
Peruru! We're approaching a fork in the road! This is your only chance!

181
00:08:21,668 --> 00:08:24,821
Okay! Blue Cop, keep up with Red Blitz's speed as much as you can!

182
00:08:24,821 --> 00:08:25,694
Got it!

183
00:08:25,694 --> 00:08:29,454
Red Blitz! I know it'll be hard, but you need to keep parallel with Blue Cop!

184
00:08:29,454 --> 00:08:31,439
O-okay!

185
00:08:31,439 --> 00:08:32,250
Here we go!

186
00:08:35,852 --> 00:08:36,832
Hi!

187
00:08:37,798 --> 00:08:40,222
We came to rescue you! Take my hand!

188
00:08:42,519 --> 00:08:46,157
What's wrong? You said you don't cry! Be brave!

189
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:48,491
That's it!

190
00:08:48,748 --> 00:08:50,338
Closer... 

191
00:08:51,138 --> 00:08:52,557
Good! I've got you!

192
00:08:53,822 --> 00:08:54,227
Blue Cop!

193
00:08:54,227 --> 00:08:55,106
Roger!

194
00:08:59,384 --> 00:09:00,431
It's done!

195
00:09:00,932 --> 00:09:03,317
Musclehyde! Rock Crush! You're up!

196
00:09:03,317 --> 00:09:04,182
Ready!

197
00:09:09,921 --> 00:09:13,392
Somebody stop meeeeee!!

198
00:09:26,525 --> 00:09:27,838
Nice catch!

199
00:09:27,838 --> 00:09:29,591
Th-thank you...

200
00:09:29,591 --> 00:09:31,855
You're welcome...

201
00:09:34,659 --> 00:09:35,669
Good job.

202
00:09:36,466 --> 00:09:37,830
We did it!

203
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:39,100
Yahoo!

204
00:09:39,255 --> 00:09:40,511
Yay!

205
00:09:41,709 --> 00:09:44,639
W-what? Hey, your spear!

206
00:09:46,784 --> 00:09:48,544
Th-this is...!

207
00:09:53,782 --> 00:09:55,490
That looks like...

208
00:09:55,490 --> 00:09:56,153
Mukara?

209
00:09:56,393 --> 00:09:57,604
Mukara!!

210
00:09:58,432 --> 00:10:00,392
Friends of the Speranza.

211
00:10:00,392 --> 00:10:04,73
By the time you wake up, I will no longer be in this world.

212
00:10:04,73 --> 00:10:07,953
But I hope my descendants will still be with you.

213
00:10:07,953 --> 00:10:11,466
Please heed my advice and get along with not only my descendants,

214
00:10:11,466 --> 00:10:15,79
but with everyone on this planet. 

215
00:10:15,79 --> 00:10:16,967
Just as you did with me.

216
00:10:19,809 --> 00:10:22,912
It's been fun, Mukara...!

217
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:30,534
Well then Ms. Mona, I'll be going now.

218
00:10:30,534 --> 00:10:31,200
Bye!

219
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,700
See ya around, Kent!

220
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:34,790
Yep! See ya!

221
00:10:34,790 --> 00:10:38,495
Wait, did that car just talk? Is that the car the one who kidnapped you, Kent?!

222
00:10:38,495 --> 00:10:41,201
Nope! He's my friend!

223
00:10:41,201 --> 00:10:42,312
Your friend?

224
00:10:42,312 --> 00:10:44,874
Yeah! My new friend!

225
00:10:46,258 --> 00:10:48,996
Now you can drive just like before.

226
00:10:48,996 --> 00:10:50,437
Thanks.

227
00:10:50,437 --> 00:10:53,213
Cheer up. We'll find Gigantrex together.

228
00:10:53,213 --> 00:10:54,466
And Jun's Metal Breath too!

229
00:10:54,466 --> 00:10:55,475
Huh?

230
00:10:55,475 --> 00:10:59,884
I'll help you! I'll stay here until you reunite with your friends.

231
00:11:00,777 --> 00:11:02,716
Thank you! You've been a great help.

232
00:11:02,716 --> 00:11:05,754
By the way, Peruru. I think you really resemble Mukara!

233
00:11:05,754 --> 00:11:07,947
Yeah! You have the same eyes as him.

234
00:11:07,947 --> 00:11:09,256
Really?

235
00:11:09,256 --> 00:11:11,413
I think I'll tell my mom about this.

236
00:11:18,408 --> 00:11:21,299
Hey, Mom. Sorry I haven't called you often.

237
00:11:21,299 --> 00:11:24,389
I... actually have so many things I want to tell you...
