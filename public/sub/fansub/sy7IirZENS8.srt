1
00:00:01,979 --> 00:00:04,660
The Greatest Power Awakens!

2
00:00:10,781 --> 00:00:12,788
That's him! I'm sure of it!

3
00:00:15,656 --> 00:00:16,920
I found the Captain!

4
00:00:18,358 --> 00:00:20,806
Oh! Sorry, sorry. Go back to sleep!

5
00:00:23,664 --> 00:00:29,562
This town has far too many cars and pedestrians. It won't be easy to find our Captain.

6
00:00:29,562 --> 00:00:32,673
Is this what they call an era of change?

7
00:00:34,295 --> 00:00:38,524
No signs in Landfill No. 30 either. I'll return to the car center for now.

8
00:00:38,524 --> 00:00:40,829
Okay.

9
00:00:41,707 --> 00:00:43,987
Where could Gigantrex be hiding?

10
00:00:43,987 --> 00:00:48,310
He looked like he had bad fuel efficiency. He'll show up when he gets hungry.

11
00:00:48,310 --> 00:00:50,118
Aren't you being a little too optimistic?

12
00:00:50,118 --> 00:00:53,936
If that guy starts running around town, it'll be chaos.

13
00:00:59,189 --> 00:01:04,444
I know it looks a little shabby, but nobody's gonna find you here. So you can relax, Captain.

14
00:01:07,418 --> 00:01:08,617
Ungh!

15
00:01:08,617 --> 00:01:11,295
Ah, sorry...! It's too small for you, isn't it?

16
00:01:11,295 --> 00:01:16,299
That's not it. I've been in pain, even before I came here.

17
00:01:16,299 --> 00:01:21,331
Gigantrex looked distressed when he saw that light coming from the Metal Breath.

18
00:01:21,864 --> 00:01:23,441
What was that light anyway?

19
00:01:23,441 --> 00:01:27,146
Well, they say the Metal Breath was a hidden treasure of Deus Machina.

20
00:01:27,146 --> 00:01:28,680
Deus Machina?

21
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:31,843
It's the name of the mother computer from our home planet.

22
00:01:31,843 --> 00:01:40,150
When my spirit and those of the Metal Cardbots became one, a power hidden within the Metal Breath was unleashed that transformed Blue Cop into Ultimate Blue Cop.

23
00:01:40,795 --> 00:01:43,246
I'd like to hear that story too.

24
00:01:43,246 --> 00:01:44,274
Crest!

25
00:01:45,343 --> 00:01:47,700
Thank you for coming all this way.

26
00:01:47,783 --> 00:01:53,341
Peruru, about that Metal Breath you gave to Jun... You said it was passed down from generation to generation, right?

27
00:01:53,341 --> 00:01:56,853
Do you know anything about it? Like, a hidden legend of this bracelet or something?

28
00:01:56,853 --> 00:02:01,549
Sorry, I got nothing... besides that Mukara received it from Gigantrex 4,000 years ago as a token of friendship.

29
00:02:01,549 --> 00:02:06,578
It's only natural that she doesn't know. I also never knew that the Metal Breath hid such power.

30
00:02:06,578 --> 00:02:11,466
Can I ask you something? Why did you all go to sleep 4,000 years ago?

31
00:02:12,466 --> 00:02:14,264
'Cause we had nothing to eat.

32
00:02:14,264 --> 00:02:16,497
For you, food means...

33
00:02:16,497 --> 00:02:20,134
It means energy sources to keep our engines running. 

34
00:02:20,134 --> 00:02:25,538
4,000 years ago, the village of Porcaca had neither natural gas nor gasoline.

35
00:02:25,538 --> 00:02:29,554
We had wind power, but no technology to generate electricity from it. 

36
00:02:29,554 --> 00:02:31,917
That's why we decided to go to sleep.

37
00:02:31,917 --> 00:02:37,281
Believing that one day, as human civilization advanced, energy would become readily available.

38
00:02:37,281 --> 00:02:40,965
You humans monopolized the fruits of your budding civilization! (FX-italic)

39
00:02:40,965 --> 00:02:44,490
Gigantrex... Is that why he was so angry?

40
00:02:45,691 --> 00:02:50,682
Huh? Ah, hello Ms. Motors, It's Edo Mona! Ahh, I mean Ms. Mona. It's Edo Motors.

41
00:02:50,682 --> 00:02:51,206
Who is it?

42
00:02:51,206 --> 00:02:54,168
It's Ms. Mona. She's a local kindergarten teacher.

43
00:02:54,168 --> 00:02:55,240
Ah...

44
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:57,257
He has a huge crush on her, as you can see.

45
00:02:57,257 --> 00:02:59,293
Does he seem a bit too smitten?

46
00:02:59,293 --> 00:03:02,780
Hey, be quiet! Ms. Mona, can you please speak up a little bi- 

47
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:03,723
Wh-what? 

48
00:03:03,723 --> 00:03:04,467
A robot?

49
00:03:04,467 --> 00:03:05,359
Huh?!

50
00:03:07,264 --> 00:03:10,793
Now, now, let's stay calm and evacuate!

51
00:03:10,793 --> 00:03:14,157
Yes, a red robot and a giant semi truck have appeared here, at the Seaside Par-

52
00:03:14,157 --> 00:03:15,337
Ah!

53
00:03:15,337 --> 00:03:16,420
Kent!

54
00:03:17,122 --> 00:03:20,823
Hey, kid! Nice kite you got there!

55
00:03:24,538 --> 00:03:26,429
Are you okay, Ms. Mona?

56
00:03:26,429 --> 00:03:29,316
I'm alright. Let's get out of here, quickly!

57
00:03:29,568 --> 00:03:34,598
Ms. Mona? Ms. Mona! She said it's a red robot and a semi truck! Ms. Mona!

58
00:03:34,598 --> 00:03:36,680
Red Blitz found Gigantrex!

59
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:37,283
Cielo!

60
00:03:38,752 --> 00:03:41,115
I'll head there first. Everyone, follow me!

61
00:03:41,115 --> 00:03:41,912
Okay.

62
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:44,961
Ms. Mona, are you okay?!

63
00:03:44,961 --> 00:03:48,485
What? A red robot is flying what? A kite?

64
00:03:48,485 --> 00:03:49,485
A kite?

65
00:03:49,485 --> 00:03:50,500
Kite?

66
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:51,990
Jun, give me the weather report!

67
00:03:51,990 --> 00:03:53,639
The weather? Why?

68
00:03:54,704 --> 00:03:58,348
When we could no longer endure our hunger, what do you think was our last resort?

69
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:12,681
Gosh, Metal Cardbots can get so reckless.

70
00:04:12,681 --> 00:04:14,663
I'm sure that's how desperate they were.

71
00:04:14,663 --> 00:04:19,310
The barometric pressure is about to drop dramatically. There's an 80 percent chance of lightning clouds forming!

72
00:04:19,310 --> 00:04:23,653
Once Gigantrex recharges his energy, we won't be able to stop him anymore.

73
00:04:25,793 --> 00:04:29,206
Hang on a minute, Captain. It'll start any minute now!

74
00:04:29,581 --> 00:04:31,187
Are you sure you're okay?

75
00:04:31,187 --> 00:04:33,918
Of course. I just sprained my ankle a little bit.

76
00:04:38,490 --> 00:04:38,533
Eh?

77
00:04:43,622 --> 00:04:45,911
Oi! What are you doing here?!

78
00:04:45,911 --> 00:04:49,420
Next time, please transform after letting me down... eugh.

79
00:04:49,420 --> 00:04:53,331
Red Blitz! I know what you're thinking! Cielo!

80
00:04:56,456 --> 00:04:59,665
No! My kite! Waaait!

81
00:05:01,612 --> 00:05:02,987
Why do you have to stand in our way?

82
00:05:02,987 --> 00:05:04,600
Look at these people!

83
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:09,814
It was you who told us to get along with the humans! What happened to you?!

84
00:05:14,432 --> 00:05:16,401
I told you... 

85
00:05:19,297 --> 00:05:20,901
That the situation has changed!

86
00:05:23,230 --> 00:05:24,213
Cielo!

87
00:05:24,317 --> 00:05:26,324
Musclehyde! Set up!

88
00:05:33,978 --> 00:05:36,649
Captain, I don't want to fight you!

89
00:05:36,649 --> 00:05:40,776
Say that to someone weaker than you, Musclehyde!

90
00:05:40,975 --> 00:05:42,249
Crimson Shoot!

91
00:05:42,249 --> 00:05:43,189
Look out!

92
00:05:44,709 --> 00:05:47,846
Don't you dare interrupt our Captain's dinner time!

93
00:05:47,846 --> 00:05:50,490
What problem are you going to cause this time, Red Blitz?

94
00:05:50,490 --> 00:05:52,834
Do you know how much we've suffered because of you?

95
00:05:53,978 --> 00:05:56,593
Red Blitz did nothing wrong! 

96
00:05:57,906 --> 00:06:01,132
He is just being true to his feelings!

97
00:06:03,288 --> 00:06:06,826
Aaaah! It's here, it's here! It's gonna start, Captain!

98
00:06:07,187 --> 00:06:08,793
Come back, Musclehyde!

99
00:06:08,793 --> 00:06:12,730
No. Wait, Jun. I can still fight!

100
00:06:13,725 --> 00:06:14,836
There!

101
00:06:16,692 --> 00:06:18,108
Everyone, this place is dangerous!

102
00:06:18,108 --> 00:06:19,559
Why aren't you running away?!

103
00:06:19,559 --> 00:06:22,588
Over there! Kent and Ms. Mona are still out there!

104
00:06:25,694 --> 00:06:26,716
Jun!

105
00:06:28,598 --> 00:06:29,995
Are you okay, Ms. Mona?

106
00:06:29,995 --> 00:06:31,875
Mr. Edo... What are those robots?

107
00:06:31,875 --> 00:06:35,884
Ah- I don't know. Anyway, let's get you to safety! Excuse me!

108
00:06:35,884 --> 00:06:37,887
You're Kent, right? Are you hurt anywhere?

109
00:06:37,887 --> 00:06:38,533
Nope!

110
00:06:38,533 --> 00:06:39,946
Come with me.

111
00:06:40,538 --> 00:06:44,158
We have to hurry! The lightning will strike soon!

112
00:06:44,158 --> 00:06:46,276
Looks like we're facing the worst case scenario.

113
00:06:46,276 --> 00:06:49,305
Yup. But we have to push through it anyway!

114
00:06:49,305 --> 00:06:51,278
Metal Breath! Pick up!

115
00:06:54,487 --> 00:06:56,507
Rock Crush! Set up!

116
00:07:03,297 --> 00:07:04,915
I'm going first?!

117
00:07:04,915 --> 00:07:07,350
Yeah. You charge in first,

118
00:07:07,350 --> 00:07:10,987
followed by Musclehyde and Blue Cop, who will attack in quick succession.

119
00:07:10,987 --> 00:07:11,994
We believe in you.

120
00:07:11,994 --> 00:07:13,240
Pierce them with your drill!

121
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:15,322
I really don't like this idea, but...!

122
00:07:16,615 --> 00:07:18,646
Here I go!

123
00:07:18,846 --> 00:07:23,475
Huh? Hey! I told you to stay out of our way!

124
00:07:23,475 --> 00:07:27,100
Rock Crush! Spiral Iceberg!

125
00:07:30,365 --> 00:07:32,617
I won't run away anymore!

126
00:07:45,961 --> 00:07:48,744
Sit this one out!

127
00:07:57,716 --> 00:08:01,350
Brachio Slash!

128
00:08:20,918 --> 00:08:22,177
Way to go!

129
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:38,677
There you go.

130
00:08:43,576 --> 00:08:46,206
It's alright, everyone. I'm here...

131
00:08:56,383 --> 00:08:59,465
The Captain is really back now!

132
00:09:00,226 --> 00:09:02,394
Now now, don't cry...

133
00:09:02,394 --> 00:09:04,591
It's okay...
Well, Ms. Mona. See you soon.

134
00:09:04,591 --> 00:09:05,331
What about you?

135
00:09:05,331 --> 00:09:08,682
There's more children out there that need to evacuate. You go on ahead first.

136
00:09:08,682 --> 00:09:10,144
Sebastian, depart!

137
00:09:13,889 --> 00:09:17,859
This is it! I can feel the surge of energy coming back to me, like all those years ago!

138
00:09:17,859 --> 00:09:20,942
This is bad... The Captain is going to blow this whole area away!

139
00:09:20,942 --> 00:09:22,268
Quickly! To Jun!

140
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:24,778
Rock Crush! Protect Edo and the others!

141
00:09:24,778 --> 00:09:26,253
Oh, okay!

142
00:09:27,802 --> 00:09:31,644
Behold! The flames of hell!

143
00:09:35,239 --> 00:09:36,392
REX! (FX-shakexl phoenixFire bold)

144
00:09:36,392 --> 00:09:38,247
INFERNO! (FX-shakexxl phoenixFire bold)

145
00:09:56,735 --> 00:09:58,879
Jun! Blue Cop! Get up! (FX-flipped)

146
00:10:00,965 --> 00:10:03,697
Jun! Everyone! Are you okay?!

147
00:10:03,697 --> 00:10:05,538
Let's get you out of there.

148
00:10:05,639 --> 00:10:06,908
Can you walk?

149
00:10:06,908 --> 00:10:08,479
Yes. Only a little...

150
00:10:08,566 --> 00:10:16,411
See that? This is the power of my Captain! You've lost! So hurry up and give us Mukara's Metal Breath!

151
00:10:18,158 --> 00:10:19,903
W-We're not done yet!

152
00:10:20,971 --> 00:10:21,746
Blue Cop!

153
00:10:21,746 --> 00:10:28,966
I... no, we... cannot lose here. Until we regain our companions, the friends we made here on this Earth!

154
00:10:28,966 --> 00:10:33,278
Jun! Please seal Gigantrex. I'm counting on you!

155
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:54,940
I entrust the future of humans and the giants from the sea of stars, to you. (FX-mukara voice)

156
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:57,296
Is that...?!

157
00:11:09,259 --> 00:11:11,239
How? How can this be?

158
00:11:12,706 --> 00:11:16,375
Why does this child wield the power of Deus Machina?!

159
00:11:18,918 --> 00:11:23,326
Now, speak out loud! Speak out the words that come to your mind! (FX-mukara voice)

160
00:11:23,326 --> 00:11:25,748
Blue Cop! Superior Docking!

161
00:11:29,249 --> 00:11:32,427
Blue Cop Trinity! Set up! (FX-trinity)

162
00:11:36,471 --> 00:11:39,689
Blue Cop! Show them your power!
