1
00:00:00,269 --> 00:00:02,527
Metal Cardbot Awakens from the Stone Tablet?!

2
00:00:11,169 --> 00:00:12,814
Wow, it's a police car! Police car!

3
00:00:12,814 --> 00:00:14,583
Ambulance!
Firetruck!

4
00:00:14,583 --> 00:00:15,410
Giraffe!

5
00:00:15,410 --> 00:00:16,527
No, elephant!

6
00:00:16,527 --> 00:00:18,783
Wow, it's super bouncy!

7
00:00:18,783 --> 00:00:21,637
Hey kid, we don't want you to get hurt. Just look at it with your eyes, okay?

8
00:00:21,637 --> 00:00:26,181
I'm terribly sorry, they've been pestering me because they really wanted to see the cars.

9
00:00:26,181 --> 00:00:27,143
Thank you.

10
00:00:27,143 --> 00:00:28,867
It's nothing! Sightseeing is free after all!

11
00:00:28,867 --> 00:00:30,634
Ms. Mona!

12
00:00:30,634 --> 00:00:33,896
Ahh! Kids, how did you get up there?!

13
00:00:33,896 --> 00:00:36,149
Your big brother Edo will carry you, so let's get down, okay?

14
00:00:36,149 --> 00:00:37,841
My precious wings...

15
00:00:38,325 --> 00:00:39,204
Fleta Z...

16
00:00:39,204 --> 00:00:40,398
Hey hey, just hang in there...

17
00:00:40,398 --> 00:00:42,335
I guess you repair airplanes too, hahaha.

18
00:00:42,335 --> 00:00:43,874
Well, only sometimes.

19
00:00:43,874 --> 00:00:45,591
Hey! Here's a giant ship!

20
00:00:45,591 --> 00:00:47,954
Oh my, Kent!

21
00:00:47,954 --> 00:00:49,423
This little runt..!

22
00:00:49,423 --> 00:00:50,581
Stay calm, Black Hook.

23
00:00:50,581 --> 00:00:51,567
Otherwise the kid could get hurt...

24
00:00:58,841 --> 00:01:00,691
Ms. Mona! Did you see that?

25
00:01:00,691 --> 00:01:01,878
Are you injured?

26
00:01:01,878 --> 00:01:06,772
Perfect spot for a landing! You're lucky, buddy. Haha. Ahahaha...

27
00:01:06,772 --> 00:01:10,617
Thank you so much for today!
Goodbye. See you again!

28
00:01:10,617 --> 00:01:13,120
Yeah! Don't ever come back, you little troublemakers...

29
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:14,405
Uncle Edo!

30
00:01:14,405 --> 00:01:16,706
Huh? Guys! You're here!

31
00:01:17,890 --> 00:01:18,995
Who were those kids?

32
00:01:18,995 --> 00:01:20,436
Ah, they're-

33
00:01:20,436 --> 00:01:22,406
And why are these guys out here?

34
00:01:22,406 --> 00:01:23,847
Jun!!

35
00:01:23,847 --> 00:01:26,840
You're all welcoming me back? Aww, guys!

36
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:30,400
Those children came on a field trip from a nearby kindergarten.

37
00:01:33,167 --> 00:01:35,109
It was a real mess.

38
00:01:35,109 --> 00:01:37,134
Look! I'm covered in footprints.

39
00:01:37,134 --> 00:01:39,554
I was worried that the kids would get hurt.

40
00:01:39,554 --> 00:01:41,329
Even if they got hurt, I'd fix them.

41
00:01:41,329 --> 00:01:42,645
What doesn't kill you, makes you stronger!

42
00:01:42,645 --> 00:01:44,138
Get down from there!

43
00:01:44,138 --> 00:01:46,268
They were more energetic than human adults.

44
00:01:46,268 --> 00:01:48,847
Their mobility surpasses that of my Mini Gallons!

45
00:01:48,847 --> 00:01:52,311
I would've recruited them all back in the old days!

46
00:01:52,311 --> 00:01:54,710
Me tired... Hungry...

47
00:01:54,710 --> 00:01:56,846
Good grief, all you're thinking about is eating...

48
00:01:59,908 --> 00:02:05,670
Unidentified dome in Landfill Site 30. Is underground methane gas the cause?

49
00:02:05,953 --> 00:02:08,638
You idiot! who do you think will read this kind of trash article?

50
00:02:08,638 --> 00:02:10,632
Uh...
Mowtown Times is not a scientific journal!

51
00:02:10,632 --> 00:02:11,603
I'm sorry, sir.

52
00:02:11,603 --> 00:02:14,657
You know our newspaper sales are falling, right?

53
00:02:14,657 --> 00:02:17,637
Bring me something more provocative and sensational!

54
00:02:17,637 --> 00:02:18,366
I will.

55
00:02:18,366 --> 00:02:19,884
Hi, Mr. Hawkins.

56
00:02:19,884 --> 00:02:20,752
Hello.

57
00:02:20,954 --> 00:02:23,293
Looks like you're ill-tempered again today, Dad.

58
00:02:23,293 --> 00:02:26,551
Oh, Vera! My sweet daughter!

59
00:02:26,551 --> 00:02:28,545
Dad, I'm a grown woman!

60
00:02:29,544 --> 00:02:31,480
You know dad, I have that.

61
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:32,620
Hm? Have what?

62
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:35,628
A provocative and sensational news story!

63
00:02:35,908 --> 00:02:41,497
Sensational news he says... Who reads news from soon-to-be-extinct newspapers these days, anyway?

64
00:02:41,497 --> 00:02:43,337
Oof. Oh, sorry.

65
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,414
Uh- what's up with them?

66
00:02:48,521 --> 00:02:49,593
Hey, do we have to wait much longer?!

67
00:02:49,593 --> 00:02:51,170
Hurry, hurry!

68
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:52,944
I need more...

69
00:02:52,944 --> 00:02:54,625
The battery is dead.

70
00:02:54,625 --> 00:02:55,258
What'd you say?!

71
00:02:55,258 --> 00:02:56,167
There's nothing left for us?

72
00:02:56,610 --> 00:02:58,602
More will arrive tomorrow, so just wait until then.

73
00:02:58,602 --> 00:02:59,992
Boooo!!!

74
00:03:00,435 --> 00:03:01,872
You need what, exactly?

75
00:03:01,872 --> 00:03:05,252
Parts! I need to invent more support items to maintain functionality.

76
00:03:05,252 --> 00:03:08,645
I was also thinking it would be good to have my own medical equipment.
Right?

77
00:03:08,645 --> 00:03:10,972
Oh, okay. I'll look into it...

78
00:03:10,972 --> 00:03:12,710
Thank you, Edo.

79
00:03:12,710 --> 00:03:16,932
Dexter, can you please stop bringing more cats in here?
Cute!

80
00:03:16,932 --> 00:03:18,895
Don't worry, this one will be the last!

81
00:03:18,895 --> 00:03:22,521
Please, let it be. I'll leave their food and snacks here...

82
00:03:22,521 --> 00:03:23,455
Thanks, Edo.

83
00:03:23,455 --> 00:03:25,780
Don't mention it...

84
00:03:28,693 --> 00:03:33,449
Jun! You gotta' do something about your friends! If this keeps up, I'll go completely bankrupt!

85
00:03:33,449 --> 00:03:36,246
Well, our numbers did increase a lot...

86
00:03:36,246 --> 00:03:41,663
No matter how many times I repair them, they just keep coming up with something new...
I know how you feel, but it's not like we can kick them out...

87
00:03:41,663 --> 00:03:42,960
Hey, watch it!

88
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:45,430
I barely grazed you and you're making a fuss over it? Heh.

89
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:48,574
What's that? I couldn't hear you. Say it to my face!

90
00:03:48,574 --> 00:03:51,524
I'll let the doctor know you need your ears checked!

91
00:03:51,524 --> 00:03:52,396
Do I have patients?

92
00:04:01,842 --> 00:04:02,955
Everyone move!

93
00:04:07,0 --> 00:04:08,752
Stop it, you two!

94
00:04:10,819 --> 00:04:15,228
Ah, Uncle Ed-... Brother?

95
00:04:15,228 --> 00:04:19,466
Listen well, Jun. If there's no incident happening, these guys are to stay sealed!

96
00:04:19,466 --> 00:04:21,470
No way!

97
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:22,893
But I'd really prefer living outside!

98
00:04:22,893 --> 00:04:26,456
From now on, when you're at this car center, I'm going to charge you for parking!

99
00:04:26,456 --> 00:04:28,120
What? You'll take money from us?

100
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:30,230
You already know we don't even have a dime!

101
00:04:30,230 --> 00:04:32,627
Charge us for parking? But we're not automobiles! ...are we?

102
00:04:32,627 --> 00:04:33,915
I'm an airplane.

103
00:04:33,915 --> 00:04:35,742
But I was well behaved.

104
00:04:35,742 --> 00:04:36,560
Me too, me too.

105
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:40,283
Eheheh... It can't be helped. Just hang in there.

106
00:04:40,283 --> 00:04:41,257
Alright...

107
00:04:41,257 --> 00:04:42,581
Guess I'll take a nap, then.

108
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:48,990
Sorry everyone. Hm?

109
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:53,776
Wild Guardy!

110
00:04:54,891 --> 00:04:56,637
Hi guys!
Anna!

111
00:04:58,831 --> 00:04:59,850
Long time no see.

112
00:04:59,850 --> 00:05:01,119
Crest!

113
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:03,697
It has been a while. Greetings to you all.

114
00:05:04,689 --> 00:05:06,764
Thanks for bringing us here, Wild Guardy.

115
00:05:06,764 --> 00:05:07,877
Don't mention it.

116
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:11,728
I picked him up at the airport, like you asked.

117
00:05:11,728 --> 00:05:14,360
Thanks, Anna. Crest, have you been well?

118
00:05:16,252 --> 00:05:17,586
...did something happen here?

119
00:05:17,586 --> 00:05:20,439
Ahaha... Let's talk someplace else.

120
00:05:23,449 --> 00:05:25,250
Hang out as long as you want, kids.

121
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:26,420
Thank you!

122
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:29,980
So what is it you wanted to show me?

123
00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:30,733
Sebastian?

124
00:05:30,733 --> 00:05:31,434
Yes, sir.

125
00:05:33,766 --> 00:05:34,600
What's this?

126
00:05:37,456 --> 00:05:38,612
Woah!

127
00:05:39,170 --> 00:05:40,153
A stone tablet?

128
00:05:40,153 --> 00:05:42,915
It was found in the ruins of Porcaca in the Andean mountain range.

129
00:05:42,915 --> 00:05:46,543
This symbol... It's similar to the one on Metal Cards.

130
00:05:46,543 --> 00:05:47,451
What?

131
00:05:47,451 --> 00:05:51,639
That's not all. Porcaca ruins feature murals of giants and cars.

132
00:05:51,639 --> 00:05:52,980
No way...

133
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:59,627
But that doesn't make sense. Cars were invented 300 years ago, but the ruins of Porcaca were built more than 4,000 years before that!

134
00:05:59,627 --> 00:06:04,112
Or, maybe other Metal Cardbots came to earth earlier than we thought...

135
00:06:14,331 --> 00:06:15,213
This can't be!

136
00:06:26,737 --> 00:06:27,752
What's happening?

137
00:06:30,961 --> 00:06:32,524
Master Crest, it's dangerous!

138
00:06:39,370 --> 00:06:40,316
Wh-What?

139
00:06:43,389 --> 00:06:44,923
Nnnngh! That hurt!

140
00:06:48,651 --> 00:06:51,778
WHERE THE HECK AM I?!?!!

141
00:06:51,778 --> 00:06:54,459
A Metal Cardbot? Jun!

142
00:06:54,459 --> 00:06:55,165
You! Bright red guy!

143
00:06:55,165 --> 00:06:56,206
Huh?

144
00:06:56,206 --> 00:06:57,233
Who are you?

145
00:06:57,233 --> 00:07:01,490
Huh! No one ever taught you to say your name before asking someone else's?

146
00:07:01,490 --> 00:07:02,627
I'm Jun Gra-

147
00:07:02,627 --> 00:07:04,826
Hold up! I hate going second!

148
00:07:04,826 --> 00:07:05,701
What?

149
00:07:05,701 --> 00:07:08,206
I'm known as the crimson flash, Red Blitz!

150
00:07:11,206 --> 00:07:12,454
What an unruly runt he is.

151
00:07:12,454 --> 00:07:15,374
Red Blitz? I've never heard that name before.

152
00:07:15,374 --> 00:07:17,399
Is that a Metal Breath?

153
00:07:17,399 --> 00:07:22,199
You! You're not Mukara! Where did you steal that Metal Breath?!

154
00:07:22,98 --> 00:07:22,829
Mukara?

155
00:07:22,829 --> 00:07:25,882
What do you mean I "stole" it? It was given to me.

156
00:07:25,882 --> 00:07:26,545
Blue Cop!

157
00:07:27,670 --> 00:07:29,449
Metal Breath, pick up!

158
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:32,100
Blue Cop, set up!

159
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:45,519
Behave and surrender!

160
00:07:45,519 --> 00:07:47,495
No way, a Star Guardian?!

161
00:07:47,495 --> 00:07:48,451
You know Blue Cop?

162
00:07:48,451 --> 00:07:50,774
If you were trapped in that stone tablet all this time, then how do you-

163
00:07:50,774 --> 00:07:51,377
Shut up!

164
00:07:53,997 --> 00:07:54,720
Stop right there!

165
00:07:57,336 --> 00:07:57,824
Dang.

166
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,408
Blue Cop!
Right!

167
00:07:59,927 --> 00:08:03,230
Let's cut him off! Crest, take Wild Guardy and follow me!

168
00:08:03,230 --> 00:08:03,723
Got it!

169
00:08:08,509 --> 00:08:10,576
Please be careful, Master Crest!

170
00:08:10,576 --> 00:08:12,478
Kids! Something happened to the window!

171
00:08:16,997 --> 00:08:18,112
Jun, we'll take another route.

172
00:08:18,112 --> 00:08:18,995
Got it!

173
00:08:18,995 --> 00:08:20,237
Let's go, Wild Guardy!

174
00:08:27,706 --> 00:08:29,396
Wuh- B-Blue Cop!

175
00:08:34,628 --> 00:08:36,250
Heh, not bad!

176
00:08:38,269 --> 00:08:39,389
Jun, hang on tight!

177
00:08:42,470 --> 00:08:43,178
Stop right there!

178
00:08:43,596 --> 00:08:45,495
You're too persistent!

179
00:08:50,629 --> 00:08:52,335
We'll have to pay for that later!

180
00:08:52,335 --> 00:08:53,158
Pay for that?!

181
00:08:53,158 --> 00:08:54,115
Heheh!

182
00:08:56,250 --> 00:08:56,811
I got you!

183
00:08:56,836 --> 00:08:58,417
Oh, bolts!

184
00:09:05,288 --> 00:09:06,748
Jun, we got him!

185
00:09:06,748 --> 00:09:08,940
Stay down.

186
00:09:09,466 --> 00:09:10,715
Surrender obediently.

187
00:09:15,677 --> 00:09:16,543
Wild Guardy!

188
00:09:19,235 --> 00:09:20,402
Who are you?

189
00:09:21,379 --> 00:09:23,383
You're the one who stole the stone tablet!

190
00:09:25,407 --> 00:09:26,299
Are you okay?

191
00:09:26,299 --> 00:09:27,370
This is nothing...

192
00:09:27,370 --> 00:09:28,475
Come back, Wild Guardy!

193
00:09:32,144 --> 00:09:33,793
Huh? How did he get a Metal Breath?

194
00:09:33,793 --> 00:09:34,533
Huh?
What?

195
00:09:34,533 --> 00:09:35,206
Hey!

196
00:09:36,206 --> 00:09:39,206
Did you forget that I'm here?!

197
00:09:51,536 --> 00:09:54,447
Scarlet Hurricane!

198
00:09:57,312 --> 00:09:58,509
Everyone, stay back!

199
00:09:58,509 --> 00:09:59,135
Blue Cop!

200
00:10:07,038 --> 00:10:11,610
Dang. Gotta' remember what the Captain said about controlling my temper.

201
00:10:13,769 --> 00:10:18,394
I dunno who the heck you are, but the Metal Breath doesn't suit you.

202
00:10:20,495 --> 00:10:21,850
What are you doing?

203
00:10:21,850 --> 00:10:24,510
Ooh, you captured a lot.

204
00:10:24,510 --> 00:10:26,272
My Metal Breath...

205
00:10:26,272 --> 00:10:28,769
Don't make me laugh. It wasn't yours to begin with!

206
00:10:33,970 --> 00:10:34,451
No!

207
00:10:38,110 --> 00:10:39,210
Guys!!

208
00:10:40,327 --> 00:10:44,466
Now, the best punishment for a bad kid who steals...

209
00:10:44,466 --> 00:10:46,134
is a GOOD BEATING!

210
00:10:47,553 --> 00:10:48,216
Blue Cop!

211
00:10:49,158 --> 00:10:54,144
Jun is my dearest friend. I won't forgive anyone who hurts him!

212
00:10:55,197 --> 00:10:56,120
Shut up! 

213
00:10:56,639 --> 00:10:58,990
If you say so... then, I'll start with you!

214
00:10:58,990 --> 00:10:59,613
Blue Cop...!

215
00:11:00,225 --> 00:11:04,398
You just said you're friends, right? Then prove it! 

216
00:11:04,398 --> 00:11:05,205
Now!

217
00:11:05,855 --> 00:11:07,201
Okay...

218
00:11:17,129 --> 00:11:18,250
What the?!

219
00:11:35,481 --> 00:11:37,460
W-what is this?!

220
00:11:37,168 --> 00:11:38,789
This power...?

221
00:11:38,984 --> 00:11:42,200
I don't get it, but this is amazing!

222
00:11:42,783 --> 00:11:44,586
Just who are you...?
