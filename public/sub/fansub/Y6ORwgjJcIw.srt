1
00:00:02,318 --> 00:00:05,230
Musclehyde's Choice!

2
00:00:15,191 --> 00:00:19,210
Welcome... How much you want...?

3
00:00:20,942 --> 00:00:22,789
Fill me up.

4
00:00:22,419 --> 00:00:24,513
Monster!!

5
00:00:24,513 --> 00:00:27,565
Wow, so much for customer service.

6
00:00:28,887 --> 00:00:30,905
Hey, Red Blitz.

7
00:00:30,905 --> 00:00:32,426
What do you want, Musclehyde?!

8
00:00:32,527 --> 00:00:38,146
This isn't right. The humans will only fear us more if we steal what belongs to them.

9
00:00:38,146 --> 00:00:43,500
You can't live on an empty stomach. That's what the Captain always used to say.

10
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:44,984
Just where did the Captain go?

11
00:00:44,984 --> 00:00:50,375
I don't know! That's why we're looking for him, by any means necessary!

12
00:00:50,375 --> 00:00:53,942
By any means, huh?

13
00:00:54,216 --> 00:00:56,389
Ugh, you idiot!

14
00:00:56,389 --> 00:01:00,890
You went out to collect news, yet you came back without a single photo? Is this a joke to you?!

15
00:01:00,890 --> 00:01:03,146
I got ambushed by a robot!

16
00:01:03,146 --> 00:01:05,810
Then why didn't you come back with a picture of the robot?!

17
00:01:05,810 --> 00:01:07,313
Dad! Look!

18
00:01:07,313 --> 00:01:08,200
Huh?

19
00:01:08,337 --> 00:01:13,409
This is footage taken by a security camera at an electric vehicle charging station last night. What are these robots-

20
00:01:13,409 --> 00:01:16,885
Why can't we have a journalist skilled enough to get an exclusive story like this?

21
00:01:16,885 --> 00:01:18,682
I know, right?

22
00:01:18,682 --> 00:01:23,756
I guess I have no choice. I'll put a bounty out for a scoop. Monster or robot, anything will do!

23
00:01:23,756 --> 00:01:26,385
Can I get the reward if I get a photo?

24
00:01:26,385 --> 00:01:28,105
Of course, of course!

25
00:01:29,721 --> 00:01:33,770
Mowtown Times put a bounty on photos, huh?

26
00:01:33,770 --> 00:01:34,377
Lavi! Camera!

27
00:01:34,377 --> 00:01:35,269
Right here!

28
00:01:35,865 --> 00:01:38,901
Mister Vance is gonna get that bounty!

29
00:01:38,901 --> 00:01:39,771
I'll get half the reward, right?

30
00:01:39,771 --> 00:01:40,968
Shut up!

31
00:01:40,968 --> 00:01:43,462
A bounty? This is crazy.

32
00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:46,926
We should seal Red Blitz before things get any worse.

33
00:01:46,926 --> 00:01:50,990
But we don't even know where he is.

34
00:01:50,990 --> 00:01:53,650
Why don't we look for him while we circle around Mowtown?

35
00:01:53,650 --> 00:01:56,527
Easier said than done. Do you have any idea how many cars there are in this city?

36
00:01:56,527 --> 00:01:59,134
Is there anything we can do?

37
00:01:59,134 --> 00:02:00,799
There is a way, but...

38
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:01,721
What is it?

39
00:02:01,721 --> 00:02:03,132
What do you have in mind, Jun?

40
00:02:07,670 --> 00:02:12,800
Hey, Mr. Jim. Do you really think you can get a photo in the middle of town?

41
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:16,920
Of course I can! I'm a pro. I don't miss any good moments!

42
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:23,235
You're too unyielding. Monsters usually avoid people's eyes, don't you know?

43
00:02:23,235 --> 00:02:27,311
I guess... the one I saw was in the mountains.

44
00:02:27,311 --> 00:02:30,286
See? There's no way a monster would come to such a crowded pla-

45
00:02:30,286 --> 00:02:32,334
I- I found one! There!

46
00:02:32,334 --> 00:02:32,997
Huh?

47
00:02:36,771 --> 00:02:38,406
What in the world is this?!

48
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:42,944
You! I knew you had a connection with those robots! Let's go somewhere else so we can talk-

49
00:02:42,944 --> 00:02:45,658
Welcome. One and all.

50
00:02:45,658 --> 00:02:49,639
Welcome. To. Milky Way.

51
00:02:49,639 --> 00:02:54,210
Welcome. One and all. Welcome. to. Milky Way-

52
00:02:56,131 --> 00:02:58,923
Cool, right? It's a robot for promoting this burger joint.

53
00:02:58,923 --> 00:03:02,679
Yup. We spent good money on it. Well, come in, come in!

54
00:03:02,679 --> 00:03:04,389
It's just an animatronic?

55
00:03:04,389 --> 00:03:06,353
Tch. What a bummer. Let's go, Lavi.

56
00:03:07,157 --> 00:03:09,699
I knew something wasn't right.

57
00:03:09,699 --> 00:03:11,241
Guess I'll have to look for a scoop elsewhere...

58
00:03:11,241 --> 00:03:16,342
Everyone will forget the news about Red Blitz if pictures of this robot are everywhere.

59
00:03:16,342 --> 00:03:20,449
I call it, "Operation: Hide a leaf in the forest!"

60
00:03:20,621 --> 00:03:22,995
How is this a good idea?

61
00:03:22,995 --> 00:03:24,411
Is he always like this?

62
00:03:24,411 --> 00:03:26,699
He's usually like that, yeah.

63
00:03:26,699 --> 00:03:28,574
I feel sorry for Blue Cop...

64
00:03:28,574 --> 00:03:30,917
It's my fault for asking what Jun thinks...

65
00:03:33,381 --> 00:03:36,620
Guess there's no way I'll get that reward money.

66
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:37,829
Excellent!

67
00:03:39,389 --> 00:03:40,774
Where did you get this?

68
00:03:40,774 --> 00:03:43,520
A... burger joint called Milky Way...

69
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:45,954
You did it! This will be on the front page tomorrow!

70
00:03:45,954 --> 00:03:49,182
Wait! It's just a robot for store promotion... Are you serious?

71
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:53,627
"Monster in Mowtown! Milky Way Mayhem!"

72
00:03:55,959 --> 00:04:04,479
4,000 years... Earth has changed so much in that time. What would Captain Gigantrex say if he saw this?

73
00:04:04,479 --> 00:04:09,771
Huh? That's the Star Guardian?

74
00:04:09,771 --> 00:04:10,330
Huh?

75
00:04:10,330 --> 00:04:11,793
Let me see that!

76
00:04:15,217 --> 00:04:19,199
Milky Way? That's it. That's where I can find that boy!

77
00:04:19,499 --> 00:04:23,516
Wha? Where are you going, Musclehyde?

78
00:04:23,516 --> 00:04:26,516
I said where are you going!?! HEY!!

79
00:04:28,273 --> 00:04:29,829
You worked hard, Blue Cop!

80
00:04:31,548 --> 00:04:34,754
Never thought I'd be acting for 2 days straight to promote a burger joint.

81
00:04:34,754 --> 00:04:38,355
But it's working so well! You're so popular on social media, too!

82
00:04:38,355 --> 00:04:40,526
Today's sales were excellent thanks to you.

83
00:04:40,526 --> 00:04:42,199
Can you do this again tomorrow?

84
00:04:42,199 --> 00:04:46,862
T-tomorrow too?? Ah... I think that will have to wait.

85
00:04:50,408 --> 00:04:51,283
Musclehyde!

86
00:04:51,384 --> 00:04:53,680
I told you my plan would work!

87
00:04:53,781 --> 00:04:55,798
Yeah, congrats.

88
00:04:55,798 --> 00:04:56,874
Be careful!

89
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:07,396
What do you think you're doing?! You made an attraction out of a Metal Cardbot! Red Blitz was right. You really were trying to rule over us!

90
00:05:07,396 --> 00:05:09,711
You misunderstand, Musclehyde.

91
00:05:10,617 --> 00:05:15,266
Jun cares about us more than anyone. Although he's just a little baby compared to Mukara.

92
00:05:15,266 --> 00:05:16,418
Who are you calling a little baby?

93
00:05:16,418 --> 00:05:24,379
Musclehyde, the Arms of Steel! You were once friends with Mukara, so you should know! You must know what it means for him to be able to wield the Metal Breath!

94
00:05:24,379 --> 00:05:28,237
Hey, Musclehyde! Don't you leave me behind like that!

95
00:05:28,586 --> 00:05:29,810
Red Blitz!

96
00:05:29,810 --> 00:05:31,442
Crimson Shoot!

97
00:05:34,930 --> 00:05:38,398
Blue-haired boy! I'll take Mukara's Metal breath back today for sure!

98
00:05:38,398 --> 00:05:39,550
Huh?

99
00:05:39,887 --> 00:05:41,776
What the heck are you doing?!

100
00:05:41,776 --> 00:05:43,850
We can't be dragging civilians into this!

101
00:05:43,850 --> 00:05:47,889
Huh! Who was it that brought a civilian into this in the first place?

102
00:05:48,997 --> 00:05:53,324
I told you, we must survive by any means!

103
00:05:53,324 --> 00:05:55,122
No! There is another way!

104
00:05:55,122 --> 00:05:55,853
What?

105
00:05:55,853 --> 00:05:58,137
Be my companion and come join me!

106
00:05:58,137 --> 00:06:00,524
You think I'd be your underling?!

107
00:06:00,524 --> 00:06:03,298
Then... how about a game of tag?

108
00:06:03,298 --> 00:06:04,879
A game of... tag?

109
00:06:04,879 --> 00:06:10,925
You're it! If you catch me before that clocktower bell rings, I'll give you this Metal Breath!

110
00:06:10,925 --> 00:06:15,252
What are you thinking? Do you think you actually stand a chance?!

111
00:06:15,252 --> 00:06:17,480
Peruru. Let's believe in Jun.

112
00:06:18,451 --> 00:06:20,786
Now! Are you ready?

113
00:06:20,786 --> 00:06:24,605
Heh! You think you can beat the Crimson Flash?

114
00:06:24,605 --> 00:06:28,790
One! Two! Three!

115
00:06:28,790 --> 00:06:29,180
Begin!

116
00:06:33,793 --> 00:06:36,331
What the-! Cielo! Seriously?!

117
00:06:36,331 --> 00:06:38,877
Surely you didn't think we'd make this easy for ya?

118
00:06:38,877 --> 00:06:41,139
Musclehyde! Go get him for my sake!

119
00:06:44,158 --> 00:06:47,170
Out of my way! You think a little guy like you can handle my strength?

120
00:06:47,170 --> 00:06:48,471
You're right, I can't!

121
00:06:51,675 --> 00:06:52,643
Get off!

122
00:06:58,283 --> 00:06:59,206
Blue Cop!

123
00:07:06,771 --> 00:07:07,749
Darn.

124
00:07:08,896 --> 00:07:13,740
Musclehyde. Compete with me! What do you say?

125
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:17,279
Mukara. I told you. Humans can't win against us.

126
00:07:17,279 --> 00:07:20,990
You can't know unless you try.

127
00:07:20,990 --> 00:07:23,300
Whoever gets to that dock first, wins!

128
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:25,396
Guess there's no talking you out of this.

129
00:07:25,951 --> 00:07:27,112
Tres!

130
00:07:27,112 --> 00:07:28,187
Dos!

131
00:07:28,187 --> 00:07:28,961
Uno!

132
00:07:38,417 --> 00:07:40,485
Hey Mukara! That's cheating!

133
00:07:40,485 --> 00:07:42,574
You can take a shortcut too, you know!

134
00:07:42,574 --> 00:07:44,141
That little...!

135
00:07:44,949 --> 00:07:47,867
Why am I suddenly thinking about Mukara?

136
00:07:48,391 --> 00:07:49,903
I won't let you get away!

137
00:08:15,747 --> 00:08:18,667
Red Blitz is right. I'll use any means necessary!

138
00:08:21,257 --> 00:08:24,290
I won't let you reach Jun!

139
00:08:24,290 --> 00:08:26,257
Will you back off already?!

140
00:08:37,399 --> 00:08:39,927
Three minutes left...

141
00:08:39,927 --> 00:08:40,470
Admit that I won against-

142
00:08:42,378 --> 00:08:46,120
Are you really a reporter? Those articles are all shams!

143
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:48,211
What? Do you have proof?!

144
00:08:48,211 --> 00:08:51,783
I lied to cover up the charging station incident.

145
00:08:51,783 --> 00:08:55,538
I don't understand. Why did you do that?

146
00:08:55,538 --> 00:08:59,548
I wanted everyone to know that Metal Cardbots aren't a threat!

147
00:08:59,548 --> 00:09:01,831
And you lied just for that?

148
00:09:01,831 --> 00:09:04,788
For my friends, I'll use any means necessary.

149
00:09:04,788 --> 00:09:07,129
Great job, Musclehyde!

150
00:09:07,729 --> 00:09:12,129
This game of tag is now over! So gimme that Metal Breath!

151
00:09:12,129 --> 00:09:14,123
The bell hasn't rung yet!

152
00:09:14,123 --> 00:09:16,647
Then I'll put an end to this right now!

153
00:09:18,373 --> 00:09:23,918
Musclehyde! Get out of my way! Scarlet Hurricane!!

154
00:09:29,735 --> 00:09:32,504
What?! Hey! What's up with you?!

155
00:09:37,687 --> 00:09:38,600
You're here.

156
00:09:39,190 --> 00:09:40,195
I lost.

157
00:09:41,471 --> 00:09:50,696
Humans are small, and our lives are much shorter compared to you guys. But our hearts are the same, for we are friends.

158
00:09:53,346 --> 00:09:54,346
You're right.

159
00:09:55,370 --> 00:09:58,801
I've decided. I'll live alongside humans on this planet!

160
00:09:58,801 --> 00:10:00,465
Now you're saying things like that too?!

161
00:10:00,465 --> 00:10:04,403
These are the means I choose to survive!

162
00:10:04,403 --> 00:10:08,778
That so? Then you're my enemy too!!

163
00:10:08,778 --> 00:10:10,133
Musclehyde!

164
00:10:11,195 --> 00:10:11,682
Blue Cop!

165
00:10:11,682 --> 00:10:12,956
Let's lend him a hand!

166
00:10:19,615 --> 00:10:22,447
Supernova Smash!

167
00:10:22,668 --> 00:10:25,897
Supernova Smash!

168
00:10:37,129 --> 00:10:39,596
Brachio...

169
00:10:39,596 --> 00:10:41,495
Slash!

170
00:10:43,149 --> 00:10:49,701
Waiwaiwaiwaiwait!! Calm down and let's taaaaAAAAAALK-!!

171
00:10:49,701 --> 00:10:52,894
YOU'LL PAY FOR THIIIIIIS!!

172
00:10:53,941 --> 00:10:55,956
T-Thanks...

173
00:11:07,734 --> 00:11:11,543
I lost. Jun, seal me.

174
00:11:14,485 --> 00:11:17,711
Then as of today, we're friends!

175
00:11:18,706 --> 00:11:20,769
Alright. Nice to meet you.

176
