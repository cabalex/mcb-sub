1
00:00:02,459 --> 00:00:05,131
The Great Cave Escape!

2
00:00:05,192 --> 00:00:06,230
Vance!!

3
00:00:09,974 --> 00:00:13,220
Did you see how good my performance was? You get all that?

4
00:00:13,220 --> 00:00:17,228
Yeah! Perfect! It came out great.

5
00:00:17,228 --> 00:00:19,797
Hehehe! That bounty is as good as-

6
00:00:19,797 --> 00:00:21,640
-ours now!

7
00:00:22,928 --> 00:00:24,736
Hey, stop making weird noises.

8
00:00:24,736 --> 00:00:25,524
It wasn't me.

9
00:00:25,524 --> 00:00:28,103
You're lying! You were like "Roarrr"--

10
00:00:30,367 --> 00:00:31,730
See? I told you it wasn't me-

11
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:47,820
So in summary, Jun lost his own Metal Breath to Red Blitz, so he had to borrow Mukara's Metal Breath from Peruru.

12
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:54,250
Yeah. I can't go back to Porcaca village either, until I retrieve all the stolen Metal Card tablets.

13
00:00:54,250 --> 00:00:58,322
Musclehyde, do you have any idea where my Metal Breath might be?

14
00:00:58,875 --> 00:00:59,914
Speranza.

15
00:00:59,914 --> 00:01:01,640
Spera... what?

16
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:04,864
Speranza. It's the giant spaceship we arrived on.

17
00:01:04,864 --> 00:01:05,671
"We"?

18
00:01:05,671 --> 00:01:08,313
So none of you arrived here on the one-bot escape pods?

19
00:01:09,483 --> 00:01:10,828
Right. The Speranza is much larger than those.

20
00:01:10,828 --> 00:01:19,131
The four of us arrived here on that ship, but now it lies sunken under the sea after an accident. Red Blitz has a transportation device that leads there.

21
00:01:19,131 --> 00:01:20,492
A transportation device?

22
00:01:20,492 --> 00:01:24,444
Think of it as a convenient door that connects to the inside and outside of the Speranza.

23
00:01:24,444 --> 00:01:25,450
Ah, that!

24
00:01:25,450 --> 00:01:28,623
That means Jun's Metal Breath is in that spaceship.

25
00:01:28,623 --> 00:01:31,974
If we seal Red Blitz, we'll have the transporter too!

26
00:01:31,974 --> 00:01:35,377
And if we have that transportation device, we can get to the Speranza.

27
00:01:35,377 --> 00:01:39,639
Then retrieving my Metal Breath will be a piece of cake!

28
00:01:39,639 --> 00:01:43,878
Not to ruin the mood, but that transportation device is broken.

29
00:01:43,878 --> 00:01:44,680
What?!

30
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:45,871
Is that true, Cielo?!

31
00:01:45,871 --> 00:01:49,070
Why would I lie to you? I heard it from Red Blitz himself.

32
00:01:49,070 --> 00:01:50,853
How did it break anyway?!

33
00:01:50,853 --> 00:01:53,462
Because you were too rough with it that one time.

34
00:02:00,438 --> 00:02:05,468
Don't be too discouraged. Maybe Captain Gigantrex has a spare.

35
00:02:05,468 --> 00:02:06,763
Who was Gigantrex again?

36
00:02:06,763 --> 00:02:08,955
The leader of the giants I told you about before.

37
00:02:08,955 --> 00:02:10,240
JUN!!!

38
00:02:11,146 --> 00:02:12,485
Vance? Lavi?

39
00:02:12,669 --> 00:02:13,937
We've been looking all over for you!

40
00:02:13,937 --> 00:02:17,901
D-d-d-don't get freaked out. But we saw a monster!

41
00:02:17,901 --> 00:02:19,780
You guys told this story before.

42
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:21,687
It's true this time!

43
00:02:21,687 --> 00:02:23,781
We even got footage of it. Look!

44
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:27,366
(What are you doing, Lavi?! Come on!)
(We need to get proof! Proof!)

45
00:02:27,366 --> 00:02:28,710
I don't see anything.

46
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:31,227
But you heard it, right? The monster's noise that goes "Roar!!"

47
00:02:31,227 --> 00:02:31,699
I don't hear anything. 

48
00:02:31,699 --> 00:02:36,155
Ugh! You too?! We brought it to the newspaper company, but nobody believed us either!

49
00:02:36,155 --> 00:02:38,533
Should we give up on that bounty?

50
00:02:38,533 --> 00:02:41,500
Excuse me, where did you see the monster you're talking about?

51
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:42,711
Mowtown landfill No. 30.

52
00:02:42,711 --> 00:02:46,579
I see... then it'll be best to stay away from there for a while.

53
00:02:46,579 --> 00:02:47,526
Eeeh?

54
00:02:47,526 --> 00:02:48,711
You believe us?!

55
00:02:48,711 --> 00:02:51,788
Thank you! But, who are you?

56
00:02:51,788 --> 00:02:53,393
I'm Peruru.

57
00:02:53,393 --> 00:02:55,658
Peruru!!

58
00:02:55,658 --> 00:02:56,300
I'm Vance!

59
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:57,432
Lavi is my name!

60
00:02:57,432 --> 00:02:58,548
Peruru...

61
00:02:58,548 --> 00:02:59,973
What are you thinking?

62
00:02:59,973 --> 00:03:05,538
Musclehyde woke up while being carried on a plane. What if Gigantrex suddenly woke up like him?

63
00:03:05,538 --> 00:03:07,729
That makes sense.

64
00:03:07,626 --> 00:03:12,221
Alright boys? No more going to that landfill. Here, it's a pinky promise with Peruru.

65
00:03:12,221 --> 00:03:12,877
Yes ma'am!!

66
00:03:20,556 --> 00:03:22,783
Is this the place where they saw the monster?

67
00:03:22,783 --> 00:03:25,271
Maybe it's already gone somewhere else?

68
00:03:25,616 --> 00:03:26,884
Oh, over there!

69
00:03:29,204 --> 00:03:30,199
Someone's here!

70
00:03:30,199 --> 00:03:30,991
Huh?

71
00:03:31,259 --> 00:03:34,983
Excuse me, it's dangerous to go camping in a place like this.

72
00:03:34,983 --> 00:03:36,185
Dangerous?

73
00:03:36,185 --> 00:03:39,377
Some people saw a monster nearby here.

74
00:03:39,377 --> 00:03:40,675
Heheheh, a monster, you say...

75
00:03:40,675 --> 00:03:41,780
It's true!

76
00:03:43,812 --> 00:03:45,194
AAAAAAAAIIIEEEEE!!!

77
00:03:45,194 --> 00:03:46,393
What happened?!
Jun!!

78
00:03:46,393 --> 00:03:49,127
Th-th-th-th-th-th-the heaaaaddd...!!

79
00:03:49,127 --> 00:03:50,557
It's a mannequin.

80
00:03:50,557 --> 00:03:51,823
Is this some kind of prank?

81
00:03:53,235 --> 00:03:54,276
What?!

82
00:03:54,276 --> 00:03:58,723
Does the monster you're talking about... look something like this?

83
00:03:59,807 --> 00:04:01,180
A Metal Cardbot!

84
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:02,216
Is that Gigantrex?!

85
00:04:02,216 --> 00:04:02,848
No.

86
00:04:02,848 --> 00:04:04,477
We've never seen him before!

87
00:04:04,747 --> 00:04:05,762
Who are you?

88
00:04:05,762 --> 00:04:13,907
Well, well, seems like my introduction is overdue. The name's Glober. An adventurer who travels across the six continents, so to speak!

89
00:04:13,907 --> 00:04:15,530
An adventurer?

90
00:04:15,530 --> 00:04:22,629
That's right. I'm on an adventure in search of landscapes I have yet to see. Although, I'm always one step ahead of the pitch-black darkness...

91
00:04:26,411 --> 00:04:29,677
Go home, kiddos, before you get hurt!

92
00:04:29,677 --> 00:04:31,543
He's messing with us!

93
00:04:31,992 --> 00:04:34,175
Cielo! Blow this smoke away!

94
00:04:34,175 --> 00:04:34,750
Got it.

95
00:04:39,728 --> 00:04:41,262
He's gone!

96
00:04:41,262 --> 00:04:42,425
Jun! Over there!

97
00:04:45,362 --> 00:04:46,331
Let's follow the trail.

98
00:04:50,223 --> 00:04:52,581
Hm? Is that...?

99
00:04:54,742 --> 00:04:55,797
An underground tunnel?

100
00:04:57,509 --> 00:04:58,305
Ew, it smells awful.

101
00:04:58,802 --> 00:05:00,937
Yeah, it smells like a trap.

102
00:05:00,937 --> 00:05:02,478
Cielo, Take Back.

103
00:05:02,478 --> 00:05:04,516
Do we have to go in there?

104
00:05:04,516 --> 00:05:07,867
He may not be Gigantrex, but we can't just leave him like this.

105
00:05:07,867 --> 00:05:08,949
I'll lead the way.

106
00:05:09,670 --> 00:05:10,583
Okay, thanks.

107
00:05:19,487 --> 00:05:21,119
What's all this?

108
00:05:21,119 --> 00:05:22,653
It says "Keep out."

109
00:05:22,653 --> 00:05:24,689
Yeah, right! Let's ignore it and keep going!

110
00:05:24,788 --> 00:05:25,740
Roger!

111
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:37,848
Run for it, Blue Cop!

112
00:05:44,141 --> 00:05:45,819
Again?!

113
00:05:45,819 --> 00:05:46,288
What does it say this time?

114
00:05:46,288 --> 00:05:48,216
"Danger inside: Turn back."

115
00:05:48,216 --> 00:05:52,326
We won't turn back because of this! Everyone! Keep going and watch out for the ceiling!

116
00:05:54,117 --> 00:05:56,608
Come on, Look out for the--?!?!

117
00:06:02,894 --> 00:06:04,612
Wait, don't touch anything!!

118
00:06:04,930 --> 00:06:06,273
Let's carefully go around these.

119
00:06:06,273 --> 00:06:07,536
I'll go first.

120
00:06:17,588 --> 00:06:18,293
Sorry!

121
00:06:22,175 --> 00:06:23,420
Turn back!!

122
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:35,439
Good grief. 

123
00:06:36,749 --> 00:06:38,269
Capture Whip!

124
00:06:46,644 --> 00:06:47,369
Glober!

125
00:06:48,858 --> 00:06:52,858
Like I was saying, you should go home before you hurt yourselves.

126
00:06:52,858 --> 00:06:54,694
I don't wanna' hear that coming from you!

127
00:06:54,694 --> 00:06:56,697
You're the one who set all these traps here, aren't you?!

128
00:06:56,697 --> 00:06:58,723
Isn't it your own fault for walking right into my traps?

129
00:06:58,723 --> 00:06:59,762
What did you say?!

130
00:07:02,504 --> 00:07:03,418
That noise...

131
00:07:03,418 --> 00:07:06,161
It's the monster Vance was talking about!

132
00:07:06,161 --> 00:07:08,156
I'd appreciate it if you wouldn't call him that.

133
00:07:08,156 --> 00:07:08,927
Hm?

134
00:07:08,927 --> 00:07:12,321
You wouldn't like it if someone called your friend a monster, would you?

135
00:07:13,593 --> 00:07:15,810
I'm... I'm sorry.

136
00:07:17,675 --> 00:07:20,649
So you're saying there's another Metal Cardbot in this cave besides you?

137
00:07:20,649 --> 00:07:24,497
Yeah. It's my buddy who's become sick and tired of the city life.

138
00:07:24,497 --> 00:07:25,487
You're kidding?

139
00:07:26,874 --> 00:07:28,377
There's holes all over the place.

140
00:07:28,377 --> 00:07:33,550
Ay, Rock Crush! Some friends are here to meet you. Can you poke your head out for us?

141
00:07:33,153 --> 00:07:34,360
No...

142
00:07:35,350 --> 00:07:35,899
He responded!

143
00:07:35,899 --> 00:07:40,153
I want to be left alone where it's quiet! I told you to leave me alone!

144
00:07:40,153 --> 00:07:41,903
Man, what a coward.

145
00:07:41,903 --> 00:07:44,831
Jun, I think we can be summoned in this place.

146
00:07:46,245 --> 00:07:47,286
H-hey!

147
00:07:48,283 --> 00:07:51,175
Mr. Rock Crush! Would you care for an interview?

148
00:07:51,175 --> 00:07:52,667
Come out and fight already!

149
00:07:52,667 --> 00:07:53,838
You got the wrong idea!

150
00:07:53,838 --> 00:07:55,824
Don't provoke him!

151
00:07:55,824 --> 00:07:59,225
I said...

152
00:07:59,225 --> 00:08:01,338
I want to be left alone!

153
00:08:01,785 --> 00:08:02,795
Look out!

154
00:08:08,302 --> 00:08:09,930
Blue Cop!

155
00:08:13,795 --> 00:08:15,512
Cielo, set up!

156
00:08:18,605 --> 00:08:19,473
It didn't work.

157
00:08:19,473 --> 00:08:21,576
Now we know that drill is super solid.

158
00:08:21,576 --> 00:08:23,947
Stop it. He doesn't wanna fight you!

159
00:08:23,947 --> 00:08:25,781
It doesn't look that way.

160
00:08:25,781 --> 00:08:29,199
Why can't you just leave me alone?!

161
00:08:33,123 --> 00:08:35,879
All of you! Get out of here already!

162
00:08:37,221 --> 00:08:38,927
Metal Breath! Pick up!

163
00:08:41,269 --> 00:08:42,647
Musclehyde! Set up!

164
00:08:55,283 --> 00:08:56,975
Stop him before he attacks again!

165
00:08:56,975 --> 00:08:57,870
Right!

166
00:09:05,331 --> 00:09:07,706
Blizzard Age!

167
00:09:11,706 --> 00:09:13,605
Oh boy. Follow me!

168
00:09:14,158 --> 00:09:16,701
Musclehyde! Get out of there now!

169
00:09:24,221 --> 00:09:26,940
What a troublesome kid...

170
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:28,947
Glober, didn't you say you're his friend?

171
00:09:28,947 --> 00:09:32,514
Tell me. Why is he hiding underground like this?

172
00:09:33,716 --> 00:09:37,831
Rock Crush and I have been friends since the days of planet Machina.

173
00:09:37,831 --> 00:09:44,831
We each took an escape pod on the day Machina collapsed. After a long while, we arrived on Earth. 

174
00:09:44,831 --> 00:09:48,514
But an accident separated us before we could land together.

175
00:09:48,514 --> 00:09:57,288
When I first laid my eyes on planet Earth, it was beautiful. I wanted to take in all of the new scenery.

176
00:09:57,288 --> 00:10:00,182
But in that time, Rock Crush experienced pain.

177
00:10:00,182 --> 00:10:00,971
Pain?

178
00:10:05,407 --> 00:10:08,844
I hate it! I hate this planet!

179
00:10:15,306 --> 00:10:19,480
Someone help me! Glober!!

180
00:10:19,758 --> 00:10:24,200
By the time I found him, he had already become a recluse.

181
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:26,393
Then the tent and the mannequin are for...

182
00:10:26,393 --> 00:10:34,403
For me to watch over him, and prevent anyone from getting near until he got back on his feet. And then, you guys showed up.

183
00:10:34,403 --> 00:10:38,724
So you built all those traps just to protect Rock Crush?

184
00:10:39,836 --> 00:10:40,730
Rock Crush!

185
00:10:40,730 --> 00:10:41,661
Where is he?

186
00:10:44,475 --> 00:10:46,831
Here's Rock Crush!!

187
00:10:47,932 --> 00:10:48,870
Run!

188
00:10:50,567 --> 00:10:52,104
Can't you at least give us a ride?!

189
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:53,875
Cielo!

190
00:10:58,668 --> 00:11:00,913
Why do you keep chasing us when you want to be left alone?!

191
00:11:01,432 --> 00:11:03,408
Oh no, the tunnel is narrowing down!

192
00:11:05,373 --> 00:11:07,908
An exit! Cielo, let us down!

193
00:11:08,686 --> 00:11:09,863
You two, take back!

194
00:11:11,648 --> 00:11:14,649
Run for your life!!

195
00:11:18,542 --> 00:11:20,889
I think we're safe...

196
00:11:20,889 --> 00:11:22,618
He's not coming after us anymore...

197
00:11:22,618 --> 00:11:27,892
You got off lucky, fellas. He doesn't come above ground after the sun rises. 

198
00:11:27,892 --> 00:11:31,384
You got your little butts kicked, so don't come around here anymore.

199
00:11:31,384 --> 00:11:33,384
Adios!

200
00:11:34,951 --> 00:11:36,542
What's with this guy...

201
00:11:36,542 --> 00:11:38,201
He reminds me of my uncle...

202
00:11:38,201 --> 00:11:40,167
I wanna go home...
