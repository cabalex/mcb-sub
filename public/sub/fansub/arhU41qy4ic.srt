1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:03,415
Search for the Speranza

2
00:00:03,415 --> 00:00:05,873
Why is she not responding?

3
00:00:16,559 --> 00:00:18,463
- The train will soon be arriving at Porcaca, Porcaca station.

4
00:00:18,463 --> 00:00:20,966
- Jun. Jun! Wake up! We're here.
- The train will soon be arriving at Porcaca, Porcaca station.

5
00:00:20,966 --> 00:00:22,975
- Jun. Jun! Wake up! We're here.
- Please gather your belongings and ensure nothing is left behind when leaving the train.

6
00:00:22,975 --> 00:00:24,432
- This is... Porcaca?
- Please gather your belongings and ensure nothing is left behind when leaving the train.

7
00:00:24,432 --> 00:00:25,890
- This is... Porcaca?

8
00:00:32,125 --> 00:00:35,280
Now arriving at Porcaca village. Porcaca village.

9
00:00:36,130 --> 00:00:38,381
I'm dizzy...

10
00:00:38,381 --> 00:00:39,435
You alright?

11
00:00:39,993 --> 00:00:41,237
Is this really Porcaca?

12
00:00:41,237 --> 00:00:43,292
It looks a lot different from before.

13
00:00:43,292 --> 00:00:46,569
It's only natural. It's been 4,000 years, after all.

14
00:00:46,569 --> 00:00:48,814
That cliff... This must be it.

15
00:00:48,814 --> 00:00:51,259
This is the place where we lived alongside Mukara.

16
00:00:55,307 --> 00:00:57,886
Is it really okay to be out in the open like this?

17
00:00:57,886 --> 00:01:00,835
After Vera's livestream, there's no need to hide them anymore.

18
00:01:00,835 --> 00:01:03,658
Hello! Excuse me, are you Jun?

19
00:01:03,658 --> 00:01:04,778
Wait, are you...

20
00:01:04,778 --> 00:01:06,278
Peruru's mother?

21
00:01:07,364 --> 00:01:10,310
You are Jun! Thank you for taking care of my daughter.

22
00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:11,406
You're crushing my ribs...

23
00:01:11,406 --> 00:01:12,727
Oh, sorry.

24
00:01:12,727 --> 00:01:16,447
Anyway, where is Peruru? She didn't say anything about coming home.

25
00:01:16,447 --> 00:01:18,179
Well, actually...

26
00:01:20,527 --> 00:01:24,962
Looks like my daughter's friends brought Mukara's friends back home.

27
00:01:25,763 --> 00:01:27,167
We're in big trouble now.

28
00:01:27,167 --> 00:01:32,569
We lost the Metal Breath, and we're running away in this who-knows-how-big ship.

29
00:01:32,569 --> 00:01:36,628
H-hey, at least we have my Metal Card, so don't blame yourself too much.

30
00:01:36,628 --> 00:01:39,485
I've been in this kind of situation many times before and-

31
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:42,739
O-oi, Peruru. Can you get out for a sec?

32
00:01:43,837 --> 00:01:45,229
'Tis of no use.

33
00:01:45,229 --> 00:01:48,507
The power is on, but the engine is not running.

34
00:01:48,507 --> 00:01:52,575
As expected. I will head to the bridge.

35
00:01:52,575 --> 00:01:54,756
This should take me upstairs.

36
00:01:58,509 --> 00:01:59,912
Ow ow ow, my back...

37
00:02:01,611 --> 00:02:03,596
Did... that sound a bit ominous to you, too?

38
00:02:03,596 --> 00:02:04,430
Yeah...

39
00:02:08,425 --> 00:02:09,335
Dang it!

40
00:02:12,301 --> 00:02:14,670
Hang on tight, Peruru! Capture Whip!!

41
00:02:21,127 --> 00:02:24,346
You two will stay here and find a way to get the engine running.

42
00:02:24,346 --> 00:02:27,163
Sky Gallop, you come with me.

43
00:02:28,872 --> 00:02:30,989
I shall remain here too.

44
00:02:30,989 --> 00:02:34,260
All the main circuitry of the engine sits overhead.

45
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:36,502
I shall rejoin thee as soon as we are done.

46
00:02:36,979 --> 00:02:38,972
Very well. I'll leave it to you.

47
00:02:41,461 --> 00:02:44,235
That almost turned me into a pancake! You okay, Peruru?

48
00:02:44,235 --> 00:02:45,798
Yeah, just peachy...

49
00:02:45,798 --> 00:02:48,161
Oh! That light...!

50
00:02:49,376 --> 00:02:51,281
What is this room?

51
00:02:51,281 --> 00:02:53,199
What do you mean Peruru got kidnapped?!

52
00:02:53,199 --> 00:02:54,735
Peruru's mother, please do not worry.

53
00:02:54,735 --> 00:02:57,275
We came here to save her.

54
00:02:57,275 --> 00:02:59,698
Peruru is in the Speranza right now.

55
00:02:59,698 --> 00:03:01,120
Speranza?

56
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:02,596
It's the spaceship we came here in.

57
00:03:02,596 --> 00:03:05,355
Now it's sunken under the ocean, thanks to a certain someone.

58
00:03:05,355 --> 00:03:07,453
Do you seriously have to bring that up right now?!

59
00:03:07,453 --> 00:03:09,609
If you're talking about a ship that crossed through the sea of stars...

60
00:03:09,609 --> 00:03:12,387
it fell to where the four stars lay.

61
00:03:12,387 --> 00:03:14,675
So says the legend written in the ruins.

62
00:03:14,675 --> 00:03:17,365
It is one of the records Mukara left behind.

63
00:03:17,365 --> 00:03:17,954
Jun!

64
00:03:17,954 --> 00:03:21,274
Mukara must've seen where the Speranza crashed!

65
00:03:22,174 --> 00:03:23,665
According to the surviving records,

66
00:03:23,665 --> 00:03:28,657
the Speranza fell on the night of June 21, 4,000 years ago, on the night of the summer solstice.

67
00:03:28,657 --> 00:03:31,401
The four stars Mukara saw that night are...

68
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:34,743
The constellation of hospitÃ¡lis. The Umoa Trench is right beneath them.

69
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:36,110
It's go time.

70
00:03:36,110 --> 00:03:38,120
You sure you'll be alright on your own?

71
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:41,600
Only two people can fit inside Deep Bite.

72
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:44,283
I should go alone to bring Peruru back.

73
00:03:44,283 --> 00:03:47,906
If only we had the Metal Breath, you wouldn't have to go alone.

74
00:03:47,906 --> 00:03:49,866
We have no choice but to rely on you.

75
00:03:49,866 --> 00:03:51,876
Haha! L-Looks like it!

76
00:03:51,876 --> 00:03:52,800
Jun!

77
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:55,123
I drew it roughly 'cause my memory's a bit hazy...

78
00:03:55,123 --> 00:03:58,647
But when we crashed, a gaping hole was made in part of the ship.

79
00:03:58,647 --> 00:04:00,573
I'm sure you can find your way in through that gap.

80
00:04:00,573 --> 00:04:02,764
Sweet! Thank you, Red Blitz.

81
00:04:02,764 --> 00:04:04,181
We'll be waiting for you, Jun.

82
00:04:04,181 --> 00:04:05,978
Please take care of Peruru.

83
00:04:05,978 --> 00:04:06,99
We believe in you.

84
00:04:06,99 --> 00:04:08,358
But don't push yourself too hard.

85
00:04:08,358 --> 00:04:11,294
When you see Glober, tell him I'm waiting for him.

86
00:04:11,294 --> 00:04:12,400
You can do this.

87
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,693
Jun, make sure to bring our friends back.

88
00:04:14,693 --> 00:04:15,471
I will!

89
00:04:16,271 --> 00:04:18,966
Guys, we finally made it here. (FX-italic)

90
00:04:18,966 --> 00:04:21,862
I'll be there soon. So please hang in there a little longer! (FX-italic)

91
00:04:21,862 --> 00:04:23,855
Now then, let's go down to the coast and from there-

92
00:04:24,754 --> 00:04:26,434
Brace yourself and let's get going!

93
00:04:26,834 --> 00:04:29,504
Why can't you just do things normally?!

94
00:04:43,507 --> 00:04:44,683
I knew it.

95
00:04:44,683 --> 00:04:49,661
The core is warped and the flywheel is rusty. No wonder the engine's battery won't turn on.

96
00:04:49,661 --> 00:04:50,709
What does that mean?

97
00:04:50,709 --> 00:04:51,932
You wouldn't get it if I told you.

98
00:04:51,932 --> 00:04:53,312
What are you gonna do, bro?

99
00:04:54,348 --> 00:04:55,658
Just sit back and watch!

100
00:05:11,858 --> 00:05:13,968
Glober, don't tell me these are all...

101
00:05:13,968 --> 00:05:15,663
Metal Cards.

102
00:05:15,663 --> 00:05:18,163
Everything on display in this room...

103
00:05:18,163 --> 00:05:19,961
are all Metal Cardbots!

104
00:05:23,108 --> 00:05:23,856
Peruru?

105
00:05:23,856 --> 00:05:26,605
Hey hey hey, Peruru! Where are you going?!

106
00:05:26,605 --> 00:05:27,963
We need to go back to the engine room!

107
00:05:27,963 --> 00:05:29,466
Why the engine room?

108
00:05:29,466 --> 00:05:35,439
Flame Nova's goal is to conquer the Earth by waking up the Metal Cardbots sleeping on this ship!

109
00:05:35,439 --> 00:05:39,512
We need to destroy the Speranza's engine before they all wake up!

110
00:05:39,512 --> 00:05:42,386
But if we do that, we won't be able to get back to land, either.

111
00:05:42,386 --> 00:05:46,612
It's still better than a war breaking out between humans and Metal Cardbots!

112
00:05:49,665 --> 00:05:53,360
At least ask me to come with you. This uncle is feeling left out.

113
00:05:59,441 --> 00:06:01,598
Jun. Over there.

114
00:06:01,598 --> 00:06:04,735
That must be it. The Speranza!

115
00:06:07,235 --> 00:06:10,411
Ah, the entrance should be on the note Red Blitz gave me...

116
00:06:10,411 --> 00:06:11,588
What the...?

117
00:06:11,588 --> 00:06:14,887
Deep Bite, there must be a gap in the hull somewhere. Let's find it!

118
00:06:14,887 --> 00:06:15,802
Aye-aye.

119
00:06:17,973 --> 00:06:20,149
Woohoo! Cool moves, bro!

120
00:06:22,879 --> 00:06:23,970
We're nearly there!

121
00:06:26,646 --> 00:06:27,490
There's only two.

122
00:06:27,490 --> 00:06:28,473
What are they doing?

123
00:06:28,473 --> 00:06:32,641
I dunno... It looks like they're trying to force the engine to start by pushing the flywheel.

124
00:06:32,641 --> 00:06:33,547
WHAT?!

125
00:06:33,547 --> 00:06:35,507
Wuh?! Who's there?!

126
00:06:35,507 --> 00:06:39,899
Is that you, redhead kid? So you've come back! Stop hiding and come on out!

127
00:06:42,124 --> 00:06:44,231
Heh! Are you seriously challenging the- Huh?

128
00:06:45,231 --> 00:06:48,540
-the best boxer on planet Machina, Spark Bit, just by throwing some trash??

129
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:49,750
Thunder Whip!

130
00:06:51,288 --> 00:06:54,466
Hold him down! I'll go stop the ship's engine!

131
00:06:54,466 --> 00:06:55,595
Are you serious?

132
00:06:57,632 --> 00:07:00,978
It's not too late. I just need to stop him!

133
00:07:05,485 --> 00:07:07,345
A little bit... more!

134
00:07:09,923 --> 00:07:10,906
I did it!

135
00:07:10,906 --> 00:07:11,487
Huh?

136
00:07:12,122 --> 00:07:13,875
You did what, exactly?

137
00:07:15,547 --> 00:07:16,771
Peruru! Argh-

138
00:07:21,567 --> 00:07:24,516
Spark Bit. Smash the core with all of your might!

139
00:07:24,516 --> 00:07:25,432
What's the core?

140
00:07:25,432 --> 00:07:26,841
That big purple thing!

141
00:07:26,841 --> 00:07:28,653
Heh! With all of my might?!

142
00:07:28,653 --> 00:07:29,596
Oh, boy.

143
00:07:29,596 --> 00:07:30,581
No!!

144
00:07:30,581 --> 00:07:32,798
That's what I do best!!

145
00:07:39,268 --> 00:07:41,475
Finally... It is time!

146
00:07:43,266 --> 00:07:45,359
Speranza...

147
00:07:45,359 --> 00:07:46,266
Rise up!

148
00:07:51,730 --> 00:07:54,406
The Speranza is starting to move!

149
00:07:55,281 --> 00:07:57,752
Jun. There's the gap Red Blitz was talking about!

150
00:07:57,752 --> 00:08:00,487
Alright, let's go in through there!

151
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:24,434
What is it, Cielo?

152
00:08:25,338 --> 00:08:26,146
Th-that's-

153
00:08:26,146 --> 00:08:27,122
What, what?

154
00:08:28,694 --> 00:08:31,713
A spaceship! It's a spaceship! A red one!

155
00:08:31,713 --> 00:08:32,942
What?!

156
00:08:32,942 --> 00:08:34,168
It's the Speranza!

157
00:08:36,769 --> 00:08:39,235
Deus Machina knew.

158
00:08:39,235 --> 00:08:43,190
That our mother planet, Machina, was doomed to be destroyed.

159
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:46,200
That's why they sent the seeds of life out into space.

160
00:08:47,101 --> 00:08:51,536
Now, my two billion compatriots sleeping aboard this ship.

161
00:08:51,536 --> 00:08:54,329
It is finally your time to wake up!

162
00:08:54,329 --> 00:08:57,970
Let us make this planet... The second Machina!

163
00:09:00,423 --> 00:09:02,932
What? Why isn't anyone waking up?!

164
00:09:04,134 --> 00:09:08,933
I shall remain here too. All the main circuitry of the engine sits overhead. (FX-italic)

165
00:09:10,827 --> 00:09:13,172
What are you planning, Sky Gallop...?!

166
00:09:13,172 --> 00:09:14,371
Hm?

167
00:09:15,173 --> 00:09:16,981
Give us back our Speranza!

168
00:09:23,928 --> 00:09:26,182
The air defense system is still up and running.

169
00:09:26,182 --> 00:09:28,433
We're not going to be able to make a frontal assault!

170
00:09:28,433 --> 00:09:31,100
That's the Speranza, alright. In that case...

171
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:32,620
Yahahaha!

172
00:09:32,620 --> 00:09:35,139
This is why machines need to be beaten to make them do what you want!

173
00:09:35,139 --> 00:09:36,844
Watch what you say!

174
00:09:38,509 --> 00:09:40,466
What are we gonna do with these two, bro?

175
00:09:40,466 --> 00:09:43,613
We might as well dispose of them, just to be safe.

176
00:09:44,211 --> 00:09:45,928
Sky Gallop...!

177
00:09:45,928 --> 00:09:48,238
Dang. So you were up there all along.

178
00:09:55,488 --> 00:09:56,249
Bro!

179
00:09:59,288 --> 00:10:01,878
Sky Gallop, you dare betray us?!

180
00:10:01,878 --> 00:10:04,309
Do not say such deplorable things.

181
00:10:04,309 --> 00:10:07,825
I was never one of Flame Nova's allies to begin with.

182
00:10:07,825 --> 00:10:10,937
Now, milady, I am yours to command.

183
00:10:10,937 --> 00:10:12,721
Thank you, Sky Gallop.

184
00:10:12,721 --> 00:10:14,427
That's what we call betraying!

185
00:10:14,427 --> 00:10:17,577
I'm disappointed in you. I thought we were on the same side!

186
00:10:17,577 --> 00:10:20,547
Thy choice is equally disappointing.

187
00:10:20,547 --> 00:10:24,517
Flame Nova's ideas are the furthest thing from the freedom I so desire.

188
00:10:24,517 --> 00:10:26,613
You're right, Sky Gallop.

189
00:10:26,613 --> 00:10:30,861
Freedom is the least necessary component in the reconstruction of Planet Machina.

190
00:10:30,861 --> 00:10:35,311
You stole the treasure of Deus Machina from me. I will make you pay for your transgressions!

191
00:10:35,311 --> 00:10:39,366
This Metal Breath was given to Mukara by Gigantrex as a token of friendship!

192
00:10:39,366 --> 00:10:41,423
It was never yours to begin with!

193
00:10:41,822 --> 00:10:43,985
Jun. Jun! Wake up!

194
00:10:44,585 --> 00:10:47,873
Ow... Are we inside the Speranza?

195
00:10:47,873 --> 00:10:50,658
Looks like it's above the ocean now.

196
00:10:50,658 --> 00:10:52,956
Over there! Let's hurry, Deep Bite!

197
00:10:59,389 --> 00:11:00,489
What's all this?

198
00:11:02,288 --> 00:11:05,889
Shooting at your ally? You're making me real sad, Speranza!

199
00:11:08,979 --> 00:11:11,190
Looks like the decoy tactics are working, captain.

200
00:11:11,190 --> 00:11:13,782
Good. I knew we could count on Cielo.

201
00:11:13,782 --> 00:11:15,822
Alrighty! Full speed ahead!

202
00:11:15,822 --> 00:11:17,488
I'm on my way, Glober!

203
00:11:17,888 --> 00:11:21,168
The next stop is Speranza. Speranza station.

204
00:11:21,168 --> 00:11:24,649
Please hold on, and be prepared to disembark.

205
00:11:29,543 --> 00:11:31,918
Blastrain is getting close to the Speranza.

206
00:11:31,918 --> 00:11:33,653
Please be safe, everyone...

207
00:11:33,653 --> 00:11:34,868
Peruru...

208
00:11:35,394 --> 00:11:36,682
Will Jun be alright?

209
00:11:36,682 --> 00:11:37,734
Don't worry.

210
00:11:37,734 --> 00:11:39,884
I don't need the Metal Breath to know that he's safe...

211
00:11:39,884 --> 00:11:43,100
because Jun and I are connected by our hearts.
