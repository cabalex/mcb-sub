1
00:00:02,109 --> 00:00:04,922
The True Master of the Metal Breath

2
00:00:05,804 --> 00:00:09,211
Let me get this straight. You'll help us take down the Star Guardian?

3
00:00:09,211 --> 00:00:10,943
Who the heck are you, anyway?!

4
00:00:10,943 --> 00:00:14,804
My name is Flame Nova. I came here to give you some advice.

5
00:00:14,804 --> 00:00:15,880
Advice?

6
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:19,647
I already know that you revealed the existence of us, the Metal Cardbots, through the press. 

7
00:00:19,647 --> 00:00:22,230
It was a mistake to pick a fight with the Star Guardian.

8
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:25,12
Even if the two of you attacked together, you'd still be no match for him.

9
00:00:25,12 --> 00:00:26,152
What was that?!

10
00:00:26,152 --> 00:00:27,891
What is that supposed to mean?

11
00:00:27,891 --> 00:00:30,529
The Star Guardian is in possession of the treasure of Deus Machina.

12
00:00:31,529 --> 00:00:33,755
Are you talking about that Metal Breath the boy was wearing?

13
00:00:33,755 --> 00:00:39,354
Yes. I'm talking about the invincible power granted by Deus Machina, the mother computer of Planet Machina.

14
00:00:39,354 --> 00:00:42,753
As long as he has this power, there is no chance for any of you to win.

15
00:00:43,153 --> 00:00:44,816
Let's do this fair and square.

16
00:00:47,652 --> 00:00:51,874
That coward! He'd been hiding that power all along, and yet he wanted to keep it fair and square?!

17
00:00:51,874 --> 00:00:56,296
You think you can easily beat me even when you're not at full strength?!

18
00:00:56,296 --> 00:01:02,238
- Flame Nova. Who exactly are you? Why are you telling us about the treasure of Deus Machina?
- God dang it!! If only my brother didn't interrupt me-

19
00:01:03,138 --> 00:01:05,155
Because I like people like you.

20
00:01:05,155 --> 00:01:09,772
The daredevils who will stand up for themselves no matter how strong their opponents are.

21
00:01:11,758 --> 00:01:14,360
Sky Gallop. Take me to Mowtown.

22
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:19,361
I have to see the invincible power granted by Deus Machina with my own two eyes.

23
00:01:26,546 --> 00:01:27,358
Now, then...

24
00:01:27,358 --> 00:01:28,864
YOU IDIOT!!!

25
00:01:29,464 --> 00:01:30,836
What's all the commotion?!

26
00:01:31,957 --> 00:01:36,553
Jun! Are you telling me that you went all the way to their hideout... just to come back empty-handed?!

27
00:01:36,553 --> 00:01:41,21
He mustâ€™ve thought that fighting fist to fist would bring them closer together.

28
00:01:41,21 --> 00:01:43,395
Violence only breeds more violence, so they say.

29
00:01:43,395 --> 00:01:47,950
Don't you think it was hopeless from the beginning? Just the idea of sharing your heart with the Hidden Cardbots was-

30
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:49,03
It's not hopeless!!

31
00:01:49,03 --> 00:01:49,705
Sheesh...

32
00:01:49,705 --> 00:01:54,693
Sky Gallop was the one who said that it wasn't fair when Flash Vector interfered.

33
00:01:54,693 --> 00:01:58,221
Not to mention Flash Vector only did that because he didn't want us to take his younger brother away.

34
00:01:58,221 --> 00:02:02,893
Then let me ask you a question, Mr. Jun. What was the whole point of you visiting their hideout?

35
00:02:02,893 --> 00:02:05,200
Uhhh... What was it again?

36
00:02:06,25 --> 00:02:08,388
You went there to seal the Hidden Cardbots!

37
00:02:08,388 --> 00:02:11,933
And to figure out where my dad is from Sky Gallop!

38
00:02:11,933 --> 00:02:14,375
Ah, yeah! Those were the reasons! Haha...

39
00:02:14,375 --> 00:02:16,269
Did you actually forget about that?

40
00:02:16,269 --> 00:02:18,159
I guess that's just how Jun is...

41
00:02:18,159 --> 00:02:20,555
At least now we know where their hideout is!

42
00:02:20,555 --> 00:02:25,579
Oh, yeah! 90 kilometers off the eastern coast of Mowtown... It's at an abandoned oil rig!

43
00:02:25,579 --> 00:02:30,794
Oh, the ocean is like my front yard! Let me sink it, and the problem is solved!

44
00:02:30,794 --> 00:02:32,256
We can't do that!!

45
00:02:32,256 --> 00:02:34,660
I'm not trying to bring them to their knees by force.

46
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:39,64
I just want to build a world where Metal Cardbots and humans can live together!

47
00:02:40,345 --> 00:02:42,388
I'll be taking my leave now.

48
00:02:42,388 --> 00:02:43,298
Glober?

49
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:45,474
May your wish come true!

50
00:02:46,374 --> 00:02:47,185
Glober...

51
00:02:47,185 --> 00:02:48,560
Adieu!

52
00:02:49,450 --> 00:02:51,520
Is it okay to just let him go like this?

53
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:54,641
Whenever I talk to that guy, I find myself caught up in his words.

54
00:02:54,641 --> 00:02:57,743
I think that's because Glober is an inspiration to you.

55
00:02:57,743 --> 00:02:59,12
An inspiration?

56
00:02:59,12 --> 00:03:04,688
Glober is a man like the wind. He is as free as the winds that sweep across the Earth.

57
00:03:04,688 --> 00:03:07,965
Jun, don't you want to live as freely as he does?

58
00:03:07,965 --> 00:03:09,846
Blue Cop, you're a poet!

59
00:03:09,846 --> 00:03:12,794
Oh look, the emotions are overflowing like oil...

60
00:03:13,294 --> 00:03:14,488
What's he talking about?

61
00:03:15,294 --> 00:03:16,970
To be honest, I've been reading a poetry book these days...

62
00:03:16,970 --> 00:03:18,605
Oh! I read that book too!

63
00:03:18,605 --> 00:03:22,501
You're already here, Jun! Perfect timing. We have a favor to ask of ya.

64
00:03:22,501 --> 00:03:23,777
Hello.

65
00:03:23,777 --> 00:03:28,620
Ms. Mona and... Kent? W-what kind of favor?

66
00:03:29,218 --> 00:03:30,809
I'll be upfront about it.

67
00:03:30,809 --> 00:03:34,200
That Metal Breath you're wearing... Can we borrow that for just a day?

68
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:36,725
Eugh, disgusting...

69
00:03:36,725 --> 00:03:37,596
Are you okay?

70
00:03:37,596 --> 00:03:39,131
Why are you asking him this all of a sudden?

71
00:03:39,131 --> 00:03:42,1
Well, Kent's parents own a flower shop...

72
00:03:42,1 --> 00:03:45,471
and they said that a Metal Cardbot once destroyed their business.

73
00:03:45,771 --> 00:03:48,859
Come on. We can't leave our store unattended for too long.

74
00:03:48,859 --> 00:03:50,512
We have a lot of orders today!

75
00:03:53,212 --> 00:03:54,360
Did they get hurt?!

76
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:56,825
Fortunately, no one was hurt.

77
00:03:57,525 --> 00:04:02,977
But it's been reported in the papers lately that Metal Cardbots are invaders from outer space.

78
00:04:02,977 --> 00:04:05,9
No! They're friends!

79
00:04:05,9 --> 00:04:10,840
I thought that if only I had the Metal Breath, Mama and Dada would understand...

80
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:12,122
We can't do much for you...

81
00:04:12,122 --> 00:04:17,379
This is a token of friendship with Metal Cardbots. It can't be handed over or lent to anyone else.

82
00:04:18,679 --> 00:04:21,421
Ah! I have an idea.

83
00:04:21,421 --> 00:04:22,622
What's that?

84
00:04:23,322 --> 00:04:24,765
Woah!

85
00:04:24,765 --> 00:04:27,963
With this, the Metal Cardbots will follow your orders.

86
00:04:27,963 --> 00:04:29,52
Really?

87
00:04:29,52 --> 00:04:30,30
But isn't that just...

88
00:04:30,30 --> 00:04:31,748
...An imitation made out of paper?

89
00:04:31,748 --> 00:04:32,847
Red Blitz!

90
00:04:33,347 --> 00:04:35,822
Transform into a sports car!

91
00:04:35,822 --> 00:04:36,625
Eh?

92
00:04:36,625 --> 00:04:37,893
Hey, don't just stand there.

93
00:04:37,893 --> 00:04:38,548
He's talking about you.

94
00:04:38,548 --> 00:04:39,229
EH?!

95
00:04:39,229 --> 00:04:40,695
Transform! Transform!

96
00:04:42,795 --> 00:04:45,873
The Crimson Flash, Red Blitz! Transform!

97
00:04:48,973 --> 00:04:51,661
Red Blitz! Launch Fist Missiles!

98
00:04:54,48 --> 00:04:56,561
Eh? Hey! I prefer kicking things!!

99
00:04:56,561 --> 00:05:00,284
Yeah, yeah! Name it "Mega Shrimp Kick!"

100
00:05:00,284 --> 00:05:00,976
What did you say?!

101
00:05:00,976 --> 00:05:03,404
Cielo! Transform into a fighter jet!

102
00:05:03,404 --> 00:05:05,963
The-the champion of the sky, Cielo! Transform!

103
00:05:05,963 --> 00:05:08,363
- Now look at you! Hahahaha!
- After this, you're so dead...

104
00:05:08,363 --> 00:05:11,405
Blue Cop, let's go apologize to Kent's parents. 

105
00:05:11,405 --> 00:05:14,388
We should explain that Metal Cardbots aren't bad people.

106
00:05:14,688 --> 00:05:19,219
- Musclehyde! Transform!
- Uh, who's that over there? The one standing next to Kent.

107
00:05:19,219 --> 00:05:21,109
There's no one there...

108
00:05:23,274 --> 00:05:24,329
Kent!

109
00:05:24,629 --> 00:05:27,330
So this is the treasure of Deus Machina.

110
00:05:27,330 --> 00:05:28,180
Flash Vector!

111
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:29,649
How long have you been standing there?!

112
00:05:29,649 --> 00:05:32,123
It's a secret. I enjoy being stealthy.

113
00:05:32,123 --> 00:05:34,72
We had no idea he was there all along!

114
00:05:34,72 --> 00:05:36,138
He used his stealth mode. Blue Cop!

115
00:05:36,938 --> 00:05:38,443
Give Kent back!

116
00:05:38,743 --> 00:05:39,657
Too slow.

117
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:43,878
I'm not only stealthy, but fast too.

118
00:05:43,878 --> 00:05:45,763
Bet you're not faster than me!

119
00:05:46,663 --> 00:05:47,897
Darn!

120
00:05:55,453 --> 00:05:57,915
Wh-what the heck is this?! I can't move!

121
00:05:57,915 --> 00:06:02,35
Stingers! Those stingers can restrict the movements of Metal Cardbots!

122
00:06:02,35 --> 00:06:02,861
Then we can easily-

123
00:06:03,661 --> 00:06:04,541
Mr. Edo!

124
00:06:04,541 --> 00:06:06,699
Jun, what should we do? If we act without thinking...

125
00:06:06,699 --> 00:06:09,341
Yeah. We'll end up frozen like we did with Buster Gallon.

126
00:06:09,341 --> 00:06:10,863
What an annoying situation.

127
00:06:10,863 --> 00:06:13,606
I knew it would be a simple task, but this was too easy.

128
00:06:13,606 --> 00:06:16,749
The treasure of Deus Machina... Acquisition complete!

129
00:06:18,949 --> 00:06:20,37
Kent!

130
00:06:20,437 --> 00:06:22,31
Everyone, Take Back!

131
00:06:22,331 --> 00:06:23,636
Uncle Edo!

132
00:06:23,636 --> 00:06:24,942
Blue Cop! Let's go after him!

133
00:06:24,942 --> 00:06:25,431
Roger!

134
00:06:25,431 --> 00:06:26,771
I'll go with you!

135
00:06:26,771 --> 00:06:28,497
Cielo! Take Peruru with you!

136
00:06:28,497 --> 00:06:29,312
Got it.

137
00:06:32,371 --> 00:06:34,641
What's all the commotion about?

138
00:06:34,641 --> 00:06:39,202
Mr. Blastrain! My kindergartner is in danger. Can you save him, please?

139
00:06:39,202 --> 00:06:44,122
That would prove difficult for me. I am a sealed bot, so I shouldn't act without orders.

140
00:06:44,122 --> 00:06:45,284
Pretty please!

141
00:06:45,284 --> 00:06:48,168
This is a matter of the future between Metal Cardbots and humans!

142
00:06:49,08 --> 00:06:50,588
Very well, then!

143
00:06:50,588 --> 00:06:52,827
Blastrain, temporary operation activated!

144
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:13,622
Stop at once and release the boy!

145
00:07:13,622 --> 00:07:16,481
You really are a Star Guardian. Persistent.

146
00:07:24,17 --> 00:07:24,563
Dodge!

147
00:07:24,563 --> 00:07:25,305
Yikes!

148
00:07:27,31 --> 00:07:28,269
Stop playing games!

149
00:07:35,930 --> 00:07:37,542
Farewell, then.

150
00:07:38,126 --> 00:07:39,756
Peruru! Can you see anything?

151
00:07:39,756 --> 00:07:41,629
I can't. He's probably using stealth mode!

152
00:07:41,629 --> 00:07:44,845
I can figure out where he went if I could use my Homing Magnum.

153
00:07:44,845 --> 00:07:46,297
Jun, what should we do?

154
00:07:47,574 --> 00:07:48,174
Ah!

155
00:07:50,74 --> 00:07:53,422
Cielo, Peruru! Chase after Flash Vector by following his shadow!

156
00:07:53,422 --> 00:07:54,157
Shadow?

157
00:07:54,157 --> 00:07:55,867
Ah, great idea!

158
00:07:55,867 --> 00:07:59,377
He can hide himself, but he can't hide his own shadow!

159
00:07:59,777 --> 00:08:00,629
There!

160
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:04,654
How should we do this? We can't use my weapons 'cause that'll endanger Kent.

161
00:08:04,654 --> 00:08:06,622
Then that leaves only one option!

162
00:08:06,622 --> 00:08:07,572
Peruru!!

163
00:08:14,579 --> 00:08:15,859
What?!

164
00:08:16,823 --> 00:08:17,465
Big sis!!

165
00:08:17,465 --> 00:08:18,799
Kent! Are you oka-

166
00:08:30,604 --> 00:08:32,410
At least tell me before you do something like that!

167
00:08:32,410 --> 00:08:32,904
Peruru!

168
00:08:32,904 --> 00:08:34,954
Gosh, you're Mukara's descendent alri-

169
00:08:36,654 --> 00:08:38,548
Darn it! We let our guard down!

170
00:08:38,548 --> 00:08:43,751
I don't know how an Earthling kid like you got your hands on a shard of Machinasium.

171
00:08:43,751 --> 00:08:45,510
But I'm putting an end to this game of tag!

172
00:08:45,510 --> 00:08:48,390
Mukara's spear feels weaker than before...

173
00:08:48,390 --> 00:08:51,747
Now, give me the treasure of Deus Machina right n- Huh?

174
00:08:51,747 --> 00:08:52,851
Huh? That sounds like...

175
00:08:52,851 --> 00:08:58,373
Ahem! Ah, ah, ah! The next stop is Flash Vector. Flash Vector Station!

176
00:09:01,687 --> 00:09:04,56
Blastrain, arriving on time!

177
00:09:04,656 --> 00:09:07,717
Blastrain! Be careful of those strange stingers he shoots!

178
00:09:07,717 --> 00:09:10,563
Do not worry about that. But for now, please step away from the tracks!

179
00:09:10,563 --> 00:09:12,922
O-okay! Let's move, guys!

180
00:09:17,458 --> 00:09:18,747
It's no use!

181
00:09:18,747 --> 00:09:23,391
Those stingers send a harmful electric current into Metal cardbots, paralyzing us. Does it not?

182
00:09:23,391 --> 00:09:26,836
I once ran on a railroad track that didn't suit me, and I went out of control. 

183
00:09:26,836 --> 00:09:32,320
But with Mr. Edo and Mr. Theo's help, I am now able to block out any kind of electromagnetic current.

184
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:34,962
And that applies to your stingers as well!

185
00:09:34,962 --> 00:09:38,204
Now, I can run on any kind of railroad!

186
00:09:38,204 --> 00:09:39,486
What are you talking about?

187
00:09:39,486 --> 00:09:41,504
Alright! Combine, Blastrain!

188
00:09:41,504 --> 00:09:42,539
Affirmative!

189
00:09:50,19 --> 00:09:53,546
You can't keep up with my speed just because you got bigger!

190
00:10:01,46 --> 00:10:04,729
In that case, how about slowing you down instead?!

191
00:10:09,105 --> 00:10:11,653
Well done! Blastrain, Set Up!

192
00:10:22,295 --> 00:10:24,862
Blastrain! Crossover Storm!

193
00:10:24,862 --> 00:10:27,249
Crossover Storm!

194
00:10:36,585 --> 00:10:38,761
Metal Cardbot! Change Up!

195
00:10:40,461 --> 00:10:42,650
Sparking Hammer!!

196
00:10:42,650 --> 00:10:43,814
Spark Bit?!

197
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:47,730
I came to save you, bro!

198
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:49,418
It was unnecessary... 

199
00:10:49,418 --> 00:10:51,106
(I believed in you, my little brother!!) (FX-italic)

200
00:10:51,106 --> 00:10:53,807
We apologize for interrupting a duel that befell an end.

201
00:10:53,807 --> 00:10:55,119
Sky Gallop!

202
00:10:55,119 --> 00:10:58,130
'Tis too soon to let Flash Vector go.

203
00:10:58,130 --> 00:11:03,519
Master of the Metal Breath, will thou fight until thou hast locked us all in that bracelet?

204
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:05,143
I'm not locking you up!

205
00:11:05,143 --> 00:11:09,556
I just want to keep you all safe until the rest of humanity is ready to live alongside you!

206
00:11:09,556 --> 00:11:13,168
And if I have to fight for that... I will!

207
00:11:16,768 --> 00:11:21,293
Thou shall continue thy fight. We shall continue ours.

208
00:11:21,293 --> 00:11:25,18
I look forward to the next duel, to see whom the final victor shall be.

209
00:11:25,18 --> 00:11:26,312
Sky Gallop!

210
00:11:26,312 --> 00:11:27,257
Yes, my lady Peruru?

211
00:11:27,257 --> 00:11:28,907
Where is Gigantrex?

212
00:11:29,307 --> 00:11:30,966
Thou shall soon find out.

213
00:11:32,266 --> 00:11:34,515
I'll be coming for you tomorrow! Be prepared!

214
00:11:34,515 --> 00:11:36,601
That decision is not yours to compose, Spark Bit.

215
00:11:36,601 --> 00:11:37,488
What?! Why??

216
00:11:37,488 --> 00:11:39,338
Please stop talking, Spark Bit...
