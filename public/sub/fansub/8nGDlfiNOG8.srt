1
00:00:01,652 --> 00:00:03,580
That's the Speranza? It's terrifyingly huge.

2
00:00:03,580 --> 00:00:04,948
[Battle of the Red Ark]
That's the Speranza? It's terrifyingly huge.

3
00:00:04,948 --> 00:00:06,443
I-Incredible!

4
00:00:07,243 --> 00:00:08,510
Could that be an entrance?

5
00:00:08,510 --> 00:00:12,180
Yes. But there's no way Flame Nova would have just left the gate open.

6
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:15,330
You might be able to force it open by manually overriding the control panel.

7
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:17,529
Alright! That's our cue to step up.

8
00:00:17,529 --> 00:00:21,814
I've also been researching the escape pod technology for Metal Cardbots. I'm sure it can be of some help.

9
00:00:21,814 --> 00:00:24,605
Rest assured, I have all the relevant data.

10
00:00:24,605 --> 00:00:25,649
Very good.

11
00:00:25,649 --> 00:00:28,295
All units! The Speranza must be retrieved, no matter the cost!

12
00:00:28,295 --> 00:00:29,21
Roger!

13
00:00:31,452 --> 00:00:33,485
I'm not dreaming, am I?

14
00:00:34,418 --> 00:00:36,119
L-L-L-L-L-Look!!

15
00:00:36,451 --> 00:00:37,700
We need to land quickly!

16
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:40,960
Affirmative! Now arriving at Speranza. Speranza Station!

17
00:00:53,249 --> 00:00:55,935
Where's your old friends and your Metal Breath, again?

18
00:00:55,935 --> 00:00:58,899
Red Blitz told me to look for the red door, but...

19
00:00:58,899 --> 00:01:01,302
Easy peasy. We'll find it on the way.

20
00:01:01,302 --> 00:01:02,735
Yeah. Let's hurry.

21
00:01:07,468 --> 00:01:10,885
This stage is too small for you. A bot who cries out for freedom...

22
00:01:10,885 --> 00:01:13,164
A bird trapped in a cage, if I must say.

23
00:01:13,164 --> 00:01:14,43
Sky Gallop!!

24
00:01:14,43 --> 00:01:17,33
This place is too unfavorable for a bot whose specialty is flying!

25
00:01:17,33 --> 00:01:20,347
Worry not, I am not going down with a wound this ill.

26
00:01:20,347 --> 00:01:22,263
Now, let the duel continue!

27
00:01:22,862 --> 00:01:24,39
With pleasure.

28
00:01:26,899 --> 00:01:29,826
As expected. The deck defense system was alive and well!

29
00:01:29,826 --> 00:01:32,494
Heh! I can easily dodge all of these bullets-

30
00:01:32,494 --> 00:01:35,350
- Boy! Don't underestimate the firepower of our defense system!
- Ow! Daaad!!

31
00:01:35,350 --> 00:01:37,706
But we have to get in there somehow...

32
00:01:37,706 --> 00:01:40,15
Ah! Everyone, follow me!

33
00:01:40,695 --> 00:01:41,735
What are you going to do?

34
00:01:46,683 --> 00:01:47,900
Now's our chance!

35
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:48,674
All units, charge!

36
00:01:58,987 --> 00:02:01,635
Hey! You've got a lot of guts!

37
00:02:01,635 --> 00:02:02,802
This is nothing!

38
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:19,634
Sky Gallop!!!

39
00:02:19,634 --> 00:02:22,943
Now, hand over the Metal Breath, or else...

40
00:02:22,943 --> 00:02:23,859
Stop!!

41
00:02:23,859 --> 00:02:27,695
As long as thou art safe, milady, I care not what happens to me.

42
00:02:27,695 --> 00:02:29,55
What are you talking about?!

43
00:02:29,55 --> 00:02:35,234
I have been wandering in this strange new land all alone, yet thou have brought back the joy of flying to me.

44
00:02:35,234 --> 00:02:38,140
So worry for me not and run!

45
00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:38,936
No!

46
00:02:44,647 --> 00:02:47,12
Metal Cardbot! Change Up!

47
00:02:51,622 --> 00:02:52,876
Sky Gallop...!

48
00:02:54,284 --> 00:02:55,400
Sealed!

49
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:56,280
Glober!

50
00:02:57,784 --> 00:02:58,868
Floor it!

51
00:03:01,352 --> 00:03:03,683
Sky Gallop. What a fool...

52
00:03:03,683 --> 00:03:05,252
Heh! Let's go after them!

53
00:03:05,252 --> 00:03:10,899
I will take care of that child. You deal with the guests upstairs.

54
00:03:10,899 --> 00:03:13,493
Blue Cop? Alright! Time for revenge!

55
00:03:13,493 --> 00:03:16,500
Wait. You're not making sense. You want the two of us to fight all of them!?

56
00:03:16,699 --> 00:03:17,893
Heh. You scared, bro?

57
00:03:17,893 --> 00:03:19,347
That's not the point!

58
00:03:19,347 --> 00:03:22,879
Do not worry. I will give you power.

59
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:23,647
Is that...?

60
00:03:25,729 --> 00:03:26,800
Next!

61
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:29,889
Hey! That one was mine!

62
00:03:29,889 --> 00:03:30,979
Sorry.

63
00:03:30,979 --> 00:03:33,465
Great work. Let's go inside. Huh?

64
00:03:34,899 --> 00:03:36,329
What's this? Are they welcoming us in or what?

65
00:03:36,329 --> 00:03:37,925
No. Wait!

66
00:03:39,00 --> 00:03:41,176
Flash Vector and Spark Bit brothers?

67
00:03:41,176 --> 00:03:43,927
Great! Time for some revenge!

68
00:03:43,927 --> 00:03:45,998
Don't they look a little off to you?

69
00:03:45,998 --> 00:03:47,700
Yes. Something feels strange about them.

70
00:03:48,401 --> 00:03:51,38
But... All we have to do is strike them down!!

71
00:03:51,38 --> 00:03:51,993
Alright!

72
00:04:00,669 --> 00:04:03,599
Was that pineapple-head's fist always this strong?!

73
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:06,57
I got blown away by a little guy like him?

74
00:04:06,57 --> 00:04:10,572
The Cosmic Stone, a sacred stone that Deus Machina hid away in their sanctuary.

75
00:04:10,572 --> 00:04:15,287
With it, we, the Metal Cardbots, can unleash power beyond all limits!

76
00:04:15,287 --> 00:04:16,850
Power beyond...

77
00:04:16,850 --> 00:04:17,968
All limits?

78
00:04:23,649 --> 00:04:25,254
Everyone stay back!

79
00:04:25,254 --> 00:04:27,690
You're at a disadvantage without your Weapon Cards!

80
00:04:27,690 --> 00:04:28,884
I'll join you!

81
00:04:34,971 --> 00:04:36,471
Where do you think you're going?

82
00:04:36,471 --> 00:04:37,786
What the heck is that?

83
00:04:37,786 --> 00:04:39,283
It's one of Flame Nova's limbs!

84
00:04:39,283 --> 00:04:40,170
What?!

85
00:04:41,692 --> 00:04:43,968
Behave and hand over the Metal Breath.

86
00:04:43,968 --> 00:04:45,182
Oh no!

87
00:04:45,182 --> 00:04:47,259
There's no point in running.

88
00:04:49,341 --> 00:04:50,630
Capture Whip!!

89
00:04:52,137 --> 00:04:54,728
I told you... it's futile!

90
00:04:57,824 --> 00:04:58,915
Dad!!

91
00:04:58,915 --> 00:05:01,603
What the heck did they eat to make them so strong?!

92
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:03,610
We're running out of time...

93
00:05:03,610 --> 00:05:04,576
We'll go!

94
00:05:05,641 --> 00:05:06,317
Are you sure?

95
00:05:06,317 --> 00:05:09,483
We're small, so it's harder for them to notice us!

96
00:05:10,983 --> 00:05:12,807
That's some great journalistic spirit.

97
00:05:12,807 --> 00:05:13,620
Guys!

98
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:14,559
Alrighty!

99
00:05:14,559 --> 00:05:16,225
Let's keep them busy!

100
00:05:16,225 --> 00:05:18,259
Should I keep running around?

101
00:05:18,259 --> 00:05:19,649
I'll cover you!

102
00:05:30,345 --> 00:05:31,146
Glober!!

103
00:05:31,957 --> 00:05:35,172
Big guys are always mean to me for some reason...

104
00:05:35,172 --> 00:05:36,635
I'll be fine.

105
00:05:36,635 --> 00:05:41,500
Keep the Metal Breath safe no matter what, for the sake of my people who sleep on this ship.

106
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:43,499
I will, so get some rest for now.

107
00:05:44,409 --> 00:05:48,115
Now, then. End of the line, Lady Peruru.

108
00:06:05,456 --> 00:06:08,0
Here it is. The panel Musclehyde told us about.

109
00:06:08,451 --> 00:06:09,497
Sebastian! The data!

110
00:06:09,497 --> 00:06:10,230
Here!

111
00:06:12,944 --> 00:06:14,975
Uncle, are you sure it'll work?

112
00:06:14,975 --> 00:06:19,927
Even if it's an alien spaceship, the basic circuitry is probably similar to ours. We'll just have to wing it.

113
00:06:19,927 --> 00:06:22,408
(Jun, Peruru. Please be safe.) (FX-italic)

114
00:06:31,679 --> 00:06:33,613
(Everyone... Jun...!) (FX-italic)

115
00:06:36,191 --> 00:06:37,658
Deep Bite! There!

116
00:06:39,17 --> 00:06:40,079
This must be it.

117
00:06:48,88 --> 00:06:50,937
REX! INFERNO!!

118
00:07:01,73 --> 00:07:02,923
Children! Get back!

119
00:07:02,923 --> 00:07:04,466
DAD!!! (FX-bold)

120
00:07:13,687 --> 00:07:17,800
Caught you. It seems those brothers are on quite the rampage.

121
00:07:22,699 --> 00:07:24,71
Ow... What was that?

122
00:07:24,71 --> 00:07:25,420
Woah, that scared me! (FX-megaTrucker)

123
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:26,870
I know, right?

124
00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:27,372
What?

125
00:07:27,372 --> 00:07:28,778
I said, that scared me too.

126
00:07:28,778 --> 00:07:31,336
Wow. That was a really big kaboom! (FX-shadowX)

127
00:07:31,336 --> 00:07:32,834
No more sleep for us I guess, thanks to that racket. (FX-megaAmbler)

128
00:07:32,834 --> 00:07:34,290
Isn't it a little dark in here? (FX-phoenixFire)

129
00:07:34,290 --> 00:07:35,682
I guess this is our punishment for causing trouble. (FX-fletaZ)

130
00:07:35,682 --> 00:07:37,629
I'm supposed to be feeding the cats. (FX-dexter)

131
00:07:37,629 --> 00:07:38,444
Me need food too! (FX-buffaloCrush)

132
00:07:38,444 --> 00:07:39,898
It's the big guys who we're causing trouble, not us. (FX-busterGallon)

133
00:07:39,898 --> 00:07:42,26
It's because that jerk stuck his big butt in my- (FX-blackHook)

134
00:07:42,26 --> 00:07:43,320
Stop being so petty. (FX-heavyIron)

135
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:44,149
You want a piece of me?! (FX-blackHook)

136
00:07:44,149 --> 00:07:45,663
Quiet. Someone's coming. (FX-heavyIron)

137
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:48,250
JUN!!! (FX-ua)

138
00:07:49,689 --> 00:07:51,625
The Metal Breath is now mine!

139
00:07:51,625 --> 00:07:53,124
Never...

140
00:07:53,124 --> 00:07:53,829
What did you say?

141
00:07:53,829 --> 00:07:57,913
I'll never let you have it. For the sake of my friends!

142
00:07:57,913 --> 00:08:00,749
Friends? Are you talking about...

143
00:08:02,24 --> 00:08:03,706
...them, perhaps?

144
00:08:04,105 --> 00:08:04,985
Peruru!!

145
00:08:04,985 --> 00:08:06,733
Flame... Nova!!

146
00:08:06,733 --> 00:08:07,697
Look at them.

147
00:08:07,697 --> 00:08:13,161
Do you really think that two species, so different in size and appearance, could ever be friends?

148
00:08:13,161 --> 00:08:16,752
We arrived on this planet without a place to live. It is inevitable that one of us will be doomed to extinction.

149
00:08:16,752 --> 00:08:20,742
Either the humans... or the Metal Cardbots!

150
00:08:20,742 --> 00:08:22,839
Now, let us try this again.

151
00:08:25,819 --> 00:08:28,848
Don't tell me... You broke the seal on the Metal Cards?!

152
00:08:28,848 --> 00:08:34,403
Yes. The two billion comrades who have been sleeping on this ship shall finally awaken!

153
00:08:36,403 --> 00:08:37,130
What the...?!

154
00:08:41,799 --> 00:08:42,780
Honey!

155
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:44,089
A card?

156
00:08:46,370 --> 00:08:49,884
Peruru! Take off the Metal Breath! Or your arm will be-!!

157
00:08:49,884 --> 00:08:51,753
Yes! Take it off already!

158
00:08:51,753 --> 00:08:55,224
It's absurd that a lowly human like you should have it.

159
00:08:55,224 --> 00:08:57,383
Coexistence? Don't make me laugh!

160
00:08:57,383 --> 00:09:01,144
To you humans, we are nothing but monsters to be exterminated!

161
00:09:04,744 --> 00:09:07,893
There is only one way for us to survive!

162
00:09:07,893 --> 00:09:11,442
And that is to turn this planet into a second Machina!

163
00:09:15,499 --> 00:09:16,864
Take it off now, Peruru!

164
00:09:17,364 --> 00:09:20,492
No...! I'll never take it off!

165
00:09:20,492 --> 00:09:24,357
I'll save... Mukara's will...

166
00:09:24,357 --> 00:09:28,721
And the friendship between... Humans and Metal Cardbots...!!

167
00:09:29,221 --> 00:09:31,802
I'll keep them safe, no matter what!!

168
00:09:31,802 --> 00:09:35,644
Very well. Let's see how much you can handle.

169
00:09:35,644 --> 00:09:38,750
(Help me... Mukara... Jun...!) (FX-italic)

170
00:09:39,725 --> 00:09:40,815
Mega Trucker!

171
00:09:42,509 --> 00:09:43,318
Set Up!

172
00:09:46,569 --> 00:09:49,308
Mega Power Tackle! (FX-megaTrucker)

173
00:09:49,799 --> 00:09:50,655
Mega Ambler!

174
00:09:51,812 --> 00:09:53,72
Forceps Shock! (FX-megaAmbler)

175
00:09:56,649 --> 00:09:57,984
Hehehe! (FX-shadowX)

176
00:09:58,484 --> 00:09:59,703
Who are these bots?!

177
00:10:00,203 --> 00:10:01,691
Spinning Cutter!

178
00:10:03,07 --> 00:10:04,127
Phoenix Fire!

179
00:10:06,32 --> 00:10:07,399
