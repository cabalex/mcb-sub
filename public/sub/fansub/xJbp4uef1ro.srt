1
00:00:02,940 --> 00:00:05,240
Glober's Last Stand

2
00:00:06,714 --> 00:00:09,913
Oh! There's Mr. Crest! Mr. Crest!

3
00:00:09,913 --> 00:00:14,970
Where is this movie being produced? Is the production of this movie even real? Or is it fake?

4
00:00:14,970 --> 00:00:17,695
Would you please desist? Where did you even hear such nonsense?!

5
00:00:17,695 --> 00:00:21,260
From an anonymous tip-off! Ah, w-well, that doesn't matter.

6
00:00:21,260 --> 00:00:24,280
Are you perhaps trying to hide the truth?

7
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:26,686
You know... about the mechanical lifeforms hiding among us in this city?!

8
00:00:26,686 --> 00:00:28,768
Let us depart, master Crest.

9
00:00:31,329 --> 00:00:33,530
So that's how it went.

10
00:00:33,530 --> 00:00:36,429
Who could have found out and reported something like that?

11
00:00:36,429 --> 00:00:38,146
I don't know. But one thing is for sure.

12
00:00:38,146 --> 00:00:42,000
Someone is trying to let the world know about the secrets of the Metal Cardbots.

13
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:51,447
Hahaha! He got you good, Bro!

14
00:00:51,447 --> 00:00:55,274
(I've never even heard of a Metal Cardbot as ginormous as he is!) (FX-italic)

15
00:00:55,573 --> 00:00:58,119
You're pitiful to have lost to Blastrain.

16
00:00:58,119 --> 00:01:02,309
Blue Cop Trinity, who has the power of Deus Machina, is several times stronger than he is.

17
00:01:02,309 --> 00:01:04,180
Stop adding insult to injury!

18
00:01:13,605 --> 00:01:16,996
Flash Vector. This is our new colleague, Gigantrex.

19
00:01:16,996 --> 00:01:20,189
Sky Gallop brought him over while you were out.

20
00:01:20,189 --> 00:01:24,344
The treasure of Deus Machina was, in essence, my entrustment to Mukara.

21
00:01:24,344 --> 00:01:27,0
And now... I must take it back from that punk of a boy.

22
00:01:27,0 --> 00:01:29,144
With all due respect, you lost to him.

23
00:01:31,733 --> 00:01:34,603
How are you going to get the Metal Breath back...

24
00:01:34,603 --> 00:01:37,472
...if you've already been defeated in a head-to-head match?

25
00:01:37,472 --> 00:01:39,210
You better mind your own business!

26
00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:40,334
Hey, hey! Not the floor!

27
00:01:40,334 --> 00:01:42,323
And why are you staying in your vehicle mode?

28
00:01:42,323 --> 00:01:45,311
I cannot trust someone who refuses to reveal their own true identity!

29
00:01:46,111 --> 00:01:47,845
That is enough, Sir Rex.

30
00:01:47,845 --> 00:01:53,578
Flame Nova is an excellent source of information. I do not see any harm in listening to him.

31
00:01:53,578 --> 00:01:57,338
If you truly are certain... then I will listen.

32
00:01:59,139 --> 00:02:00,586
Very well.

33
00:02:00,921 --> 00:02:06,816
This shark movie was a fake advertisement. Who would put out a fake ad, and for what purpose? It's obvious!

34
00:02:06,816 --> 00:02:11,541
Metal Cardbots are already hiding among us, trying to make us let down our guard!

35
00:02:11,541 --> 00:02:14,866
I don't think the day of their Earthly invasion is far off.

36
00:02:14,866 --> 00:02:18,868
This is Warren Williams, the Editor-in-chief from Mowtown Times, signing off.

37
00:02:18,868 --> 00:02:21,170
Hmm, invaders?

38
00:02:24,373 --> 00:02:27,801
My name is Fleta Z. I am a fan of yours. (FX-italic)

39
00:02:27,801 --> 00:02:32,849
Are Metal Cardbots really invaders? It didn't seem that way...

40
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:39,608
"I'll tell you the secret of the Metal Cardbots. Meet me at the Mowtown Wharf."

41
00:02:39,608 --> 00:02:42,900
What is this? Who sent this-? ...it's anonymous?! 

42
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:49,415
This is my best shot to uncover the secrets of the Metal Cardbots! If I get the right shot, my views will skyrocket!

43
00:02:53,477 --> 00:02:55,38
Hello?

44
00:02:55,38 --> 00:02:59,269
Huh. Nobody's here. Did I get here before them? 

45
00:02:59,269 --> 00:03:02,100
I'm sure this is the right place...

46
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:05,310
If you are looking for me, I'm here.

47
00:03:05,770 --> 00:03:06,680
Eh?!

48
00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:10,990
You must be a Metal Cardbot! Then the one who called me here must be-

49
00:03:10,990 --> 00:03:12,401
Yes. Me.

50
00:03:12,401 --> 00:03:18,443
Oh, my! Is he also a fan of me? I must really be popular among these robots!

51
00:03:18,443 --> 00:03:20,245
So what's that secret you wanted to-

52
00:03:21,711 --> 00:03:22,723
Capture Whip!

53
00:03:25,372 --> 00:03:27,610
A-Another Metal Cardbot?!

54
00:03:28,211 --> 00:03:29,471
Who are you?

55
00:03:29,471 --> 00:03:31,406
Just a wanderer who happened to be passing by.

56
00:03:31,406 --> 00:03:35,42
Might I ask why you're attacking an innocent human?

57
00:03:35,641 --> 00:03:38,327
The Star Guardian operates on justice.

58
00:03:38,327 --> 00:03:42,413
If you make a big scene, he's sure to be there with that little runt named Jun.

59
00:03:42,413 --> 00:03:43,670
What do you mean by a big scene?

60
00:03:43,670 --> 00:03:44,836
It's simple.

61
00:03:44,836 --> 00:03:46,419
Attack the humans.

62
00:03:46,419 --> 00:03:49,603
Better yet, target their celebrities that can do livestreams.

63
00:03:49,603 --> 00:03:51,164
I have my reasons.

64
00:03:51,164 --> 00:03:55,893
I don't think an old man who has been asleep for 4,000 years knows how to send an e-mail.

65
00:03:55,893 --> 00:03:58,67
Which means there's another guy who hides behind you, pulling the strings...

66
00:03:58,67 --> 00:04:01,841
all to stir up a conflict between the humans living here and Metal Cardbots!

67
00:04:02,841 --> 00:04:04,501
This has nothing to do with you!

68
00:04:09,216 --> 00:04:10,278
Cutter Whip!

69
00:04:14,292 --> 00:04:17,828
D-Did that dirty robot just save me?!

70
00:04:17,828 --> 00:04:18,964
This is no time for gawking!

71
00:04:21,09 --> 00:04:22,651
Guys! We have trouble!

72
00:04:23,753 --> 00:04:25,120
Glober! And...

73
00:04:26,562 --> 00:04:27,322
It's Dad!!

74
00:04:27,322 --> 00:04:28,393
Why is the captain-

75
00:04:28,393 --> 00:04:30,221
-Fighting with Glober?!

76
00:04:31,744 --> 00:04:33,257
Where are you going all of a sudden?!

77
00:04:43,454 --> 00:04:44,969
Thunder Whip!

78
00:04:48,485 --> 00:04:51,472
This is not a dream, nor fake footage.

79
00:04:51,472 --> 00:04:54,860
Metal Cardbots are actually fighting right now, right before my eyes!

80
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:56,749
Guys!! We have- Uh?

81
00:04:56,749 --> 00:05:00,663
And there's more. That filthy Metal Cardbot just saved my life!

82
00:05:00,663 --> 00:05:02,129
Who's broadcasting such a big scoop like this?

83
00:05:02,129 --> 00:05:06,119
Why, I dunno. Maybe because I'm pretty? Duh?

84
00:05:06,119 --> 00:05:07,274
Vera!!

85
00:05:13,625 --> 00:05:15,425
Hey kid, what are you doing?! Run along!

86
00:05:15,425 --> 00:05:17,331
What? And miss this scoop??

87
00:05:18,862 --> 00:05:19,663
There!

88
00:05:26,437 --> 00:05:28,250
You tiresome wretch.

89
00:05:31,863 --> 00:05:32,674
Dang-!

90
00:05:49,764 --> 00:05:51,391
Death Grip!

91
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:58,747
You're next.

92
00:05:59,778 --> 00:06:03,067
W-w-w-wait. What d-d-d-did I do?!

93
00:06:04,367 --> 00:06:07,369
Don't you look away... I ain't done yet!

94
00:06:07,369 --> 00:06:09,105
Persistent fool.

95
00:06:09,105 --> 00:06:11,577
REX INFERNO!!

96
00:06:20,651 --> 00:06:23,567
H-hey! Ow! Are you okay?!

97
00:06:23,567 --> 00:06:25,823
The instigator is gone now.

98
00:06:25,823 --> 00:06:27,678
And you will follow right behind him!

99
00:06:30,279 --> 00:06:31,446
You're finally here.

100
00:06:32,855 --> 00:06:33,903
D-Dad!!

101
00:06:33,903 --> 00:06:34,769
Glober!!

102
00:06:35,69 --> 00:06:39,09
This time, I will finally take back my Metal Breath!

103
00:06:39,09 --> 00:06:40,809
No. 'Tis all of ours!

104
00:06:48,192 --> 00:06:53,444
"My" Metal Breath... Thou better not forget what was agreed upon for this operation, Sir Rex.

105
00:06:54,144 --> 00:06:54,846
Hmph.

106
00:06:55,807 --> 00:07:00,177
Now, young sir... It seems our time does call upon's the Metal Breath to change hands.

107
00:07:00,177 --> 00:07:03,298
W-Why is my dad working with the Hidden Cardbots?!

108
00:07:03,598 --> 00:07:06,860
Glober... Guys! Can I leave him to you?

109
00:07:06,99 --> 00:07:07,884
Of course.

110
00:07:07,884 --> 00:07:09,362
Don't worry. Go do your thing.

111
00:07:09,762 --> 00:07:11,410
Stop procrastinating and give it up already!

112
00:07:12,435 --> 00:07:13,430
Captain!!

113
00:07:15,762 --> 00:07:17,184
Let go of me!!

114
00:07:17,184 --> 00:07:19,295
Captain, come with us already!

115
00:07:19,295 --> 00:07:20,843
We'll fix you up!

116
00:07:20,843 --> 00:07:24,29
DAAAAAAAAAAD!!! (FX-sarcasm)

117
00:07:24,29 --> 00:07:25,356
Wha-! He's getting away!

118
00:07:25,356 --> 00:07:26,257
Where do you think you're going?!

119
00:07:28,622 --> 00:07:29,449
Jun! Go!

120
00:07:30,490 --> 00:07:33,379
You think you can stop us with those peashooters?!

121
00:07:34,387 --> 00:07:37,293
Jun! It'll be hard For Blue Cop to do this alone. I'll help him!

122
00:07:37,293 --> 00:07:38,543
I'll cover him too!

123
00:07:39,129 --> 00:07:39,761
Alright!

124
00:07:44,129 --> 00:07:45,259
Take care of Glober!

125
00:07:46,168 --> 00:07:47,243
Open fire!

126
00:07:49,363 --> 00:07:52,634
Cowards. Ranged attacks against us melee specialists?!

127
00:07:53,435 --> 00:07:55,827
Thou should'st be ashamed of yourself for running away!

128
00:07:56,827 --> 00:07:58,173
Jun! I'll fight too!

129
00:07:58,173 --> 00:07:58,971
Rock Crush!

130
00:08:02,242 --> 00:08:03,925
Blizzard Age!

131
00:08:09,776 --> 00:08:11,786
Blizzard Age!

132
00:08:16,829 --> 00:08:18,774
Such disgrace...!

133
00:08:21,704 --> 00:08:25,105
I'll stay on guard here. Please save Glober!

134
00:08:25,105 --> 00:08:26,100
You can count on me!

135
00:08:28,430 --> 00:08:31,295
There are so many Metal Cardbots!

136
00:08:34,495 --> 00:08:37,927
H-Hey. Why did you save me?

137
00:08:38,226 --> 00:08:40,516
I didn't actually mean to help you.

138
00:08:40,516 --> 00:08:45,405
But... I knew if I looked away, that kiddo's gonna' get real sad.

139
00:08:45,405 --> 00:08:46,174
That kiddo?

140
00:08:46,174 --> 00:08:49,519
Glober! Glober!! Glo- Huh?

141
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:53,565
Hey kid, what's up? The weather's really bad, huh?

142
00:08:53,565 --> 00:08:56,29
Glober, let me seal you.

143
00:08:56,29 --> 00:08:58,899
I want to live freely. Leave me be.

144
00:08:58,899 --> 00:09:00,899
How can you expect me to leave a friend to die?!

145
00:09:00,899 --> 00:09:01,681
Friend...?

146
00:09:01,681 --> 00:09:05,722
Hahaha... A friend... You're making me blush.

147
00:09:05,722 --> 00:09:08,728
Staying in the Metal Breath will help you recover.

148
00:09:08,728 --> 00:09:12,933
We can go to Uncle Edo's and get you fully repaired, and then you can live free again!

149
00:09:19,924 --> 00:09:24,710
You're too stubborn for a little guy. Do whatever you want.

150
00:09:26,139 --> 00:09:28,471
Metal Cardbot! Change Up!

151
00:09:28,471 --> 00:09:32,128
Good grief. I don't like how the sky looks today...

152
00:09:37,923 --> 00:09:39,652
Take it easy now, Glober.

153
00:09:39,951 --> 00:09:41,549
What the heck was that?!

154
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:44,802
Uh... Are you still streaming right now?

155
00:09:44,802 --> 00:09:45,719
Jun...

156
00:09:48,341 --> 00:09:50,620
Rock Crush! Vera, stay here!

157
00:09:55,707 --> 00:09:58,738
Blastrain! Combine and supress Sky Gallop!

158
00:09:58,738 --> 00:10:00,903
Affirmative! I'll leave them to you!

159
00:10:01,855 --> 00:10:02,467
You dare?!

160
00:10:06,159 --> 00:10:10,942
Attention all passengers, please stand behind the yellow line!

161
00:10:12,707 --> 00:10:14,259
Blastrain! Set up!

162
00:10:16,552 --> 00:10:19,379
Finally, a worthy opponent has appeared!

163
00:10:19,778 --> 00:10:22,338
Deep Bite! Go for Spark Bit!

164
00:10:25,561 --> 00:10:26,141
Little brother!!

165
00:10:26,908 --> 00:10:30,914
So Metal Cardbots were hiding among human society, disguised as vehicles.

166
00:10:35,232 --> 00:10:36,239
Deep Bite!

167
00:10:37,578 --> 00:10:42,229
Right now, a lot of people in the world consider Metal Cardbots to be invaders.

168
00:10:42,229 --> 00:10:44,919
I used to think so, too. 

169
00:10:44,919 --> 00:10:48,408
But as you've already seen, there are some Metal Cardbots that aren't!

170
00:10:48,408 --> 00:10:51,946
And there's a kid who calls them his friends!

171
00:10:52,346 --> 00:10:53,518
Captain!

172
00:10:53,518 --> 00:10:55,209
Dad!!

173
00:10:59,245 --> 00:11:00,989
GIVE ME BACK MY METAL BREATH!!

174
00:11:01,551 --> 00:11:03,168
Oh no! Jun!

175
00:11:19,399 --> 00:11:21,423
Could that be the power of Deus Machina?

176
00:11:21,423 --> 00:11:23,751
Please keep your eyes on the road!
