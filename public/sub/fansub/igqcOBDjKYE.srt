Era of Change

2
00:01:21,537 --> 00:01:23,436
C'mon, bus driver! Do something!!

3
00:01:23,436 --> 00:01:25,260
I've lost control of the engine!

4
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,960
Everyone! Please hold on tight!

5
00:01:49,346 --> 00:01:53,055
- Thank you!
- You saved us, Blue Cop!

6
00:01:54,454 --> 00:01:58,260
Four thousand years ago, from the farthest reaches of the vast universe...

7
00:01:58,260 --> 00:02:02,668
metal-bodied mechanical lifeforms came to Earth. They are... the Metal Cardbots!

8
00:02:02,668 --> 00:02:05,084
They no longer have a place to return to,

9
00:02:05,084 --> 00:02:08,300
because their home planet, Machina, was destroyed a long time ago.

10
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:10,956
Mowtown's mayor Jacques once said...

11
00:02:10,956 --> 00:02:15,013
So long as they learn about Earth's customs and uphold our laws,

12
00:02:15,013 --> 00:02:18,669
humans and Metal Cardbots will be able to live alongside one another!

13
00:02:20,669 --> 00:02:24,045
The Metal Cardbots have lived up to these expectations.

14
00:02:24,045 --> 00:02:30,223
They spread out and got to work to prove that Metal Cardbots and humans can help one another.

15
00:02:30,223 --> 00:02:35,414
Now Metal Cardbots and us humans are joining forces, working hard to keep Earth safe.

16
00:02:43,115 --> 00:02:47,281
And, uh... that concludes our presentation. Thank you!

17
00:02:49,481 --> 00:02:50,743
I'm deeply moved, Jun!

18
00:02:50,743 --> 00:02:54,675
I had no idea you were the link connecting Metal Cardbots with humans!

19
00:02:54,675 --> 00:02:57,006
I'm so proud of you, as one of your best friends!

20
00:02:57,006 --> 00:02:58,673
I'm also proud of you, Jun!

21
00:02:58,673 --> 00:02:59,514
Right...

22
00:03:00,453 --> 00:03:02,479
Does anyone have any questions?

23
00:03:02,479 --> 00:03:04,354
How long have you been hiding this...?

24
00:03:04,354 --> 00:03:05,685
Uh... Hiding what?

25
00:03:05,685 --> 00:03:08,872
Don't play dumb with me! I know you've been lying this whole time!

26
00:03:08,872 --> 00:03:10,687
Uh, that's because...

27
00:03:10,687 --> 00:03:13,301
I admit, I'm also proud of you as a friend too.

28
00:03:13,301 --> 00:03:17,914
But I absolutely cannot forgive anyone for being more popular than me at this school!

29
00:03:17,914 --> 00:03:21,456
Hey, by the way... what's it like to be inside of a Metal Cardbot?

30
00:03:21,456 --> 00:03:22,930
Give me a ride in one of them next time too!

31
00:03:22,930 --> 00:03:23,890
Me too! Me too!

32
00:03:25,656 --> 00:03:28,877
This makes no sense! How can he be more popular than me?!

33
00:03:29,377 --> 00:03:32,371
Ugh. I never wanted to become famous...

34
00:03:32,371 --> 00:03:35,795
But in a way, you did practically save the world.

35
00:03:35,795 --> 00:03:40,355
There's no denying that you're doing great as a mediator between humans and Metal Cardbots.

36
00:03:40,355 --> 00:03:41,442
I agree.

37
00:03:41,843 --> 00:03:42,691
Blue Cop!

38
00:03:42,691 --> 00:03:43,675
Are you on duty?

39
00:03:43,675 --> 00:03:46,474
My shift is over. After all, we promised to meet with everyone today.

40
00:03:49,175 --> 00:03:50,287
Wild Guardy!

41
00:03:51,187 --> 00:03:52,301
Hello everyone.

42
00:03:52,301 --> 00:03:53,108
Crest!

43
00:03:53,108 --> 00:03:54,168
You're here early.

44
00:03:54,168 --> 00:03:56,371
We can't be late on a day like today.

45
00:03:59,079 --> 00:04:01,895
Whaaat?! You're working on a farm now?!

46
00:04:01,895 --> 00:04:04,560
Yes. Plowing the fields, tending to the horses and cattle...

47
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:08,223
It's indescribably satisfying to see the vast land managed all according to plan.

48
00:04:08,223 --> 00:04:10,231
You are pretty meticulous, I'll give you that.

49
00:04:10,231 --> 00:04:12,711
What on earth happened while we were away?

50
00:04:12,711 --> 00:04:14,212
Everything's changed.

51
00:04:14,212 --> 00:04:15,194
It end of the world.

52
00:04:15,194 --> 00:04:17,713
Change means we’re making progress.

53
00:04:17,713 --> 00:04:19,672
Jun's hairstyle has progressed quite nicely, too.

54
00:04:19,672 --> 00:04:22,901
It still feels kinda weird. My mom forced me to get a haircut.

55
00:04:22,901 --> 00:04:25,452
You're going to be on TV a lot, so cut your hair! (FX-italic)

56
00:04:25,552 --> 00:04:27,406
Hahaha. Well, I like your progress.

57
00:04:27,406 --> 00:04:29,057
To hell with progress!

58
00:04:30,057 --> 00:04:32,098
What has Uncle Edo so upset?

59
00:04:32,098 --> 00:04:33,432
It's because...

60
00:04:33,432 --> 00:04:34,805
WHAT?! HE GOT DUMPED BY MS. MO-?!

61
00:04:34,805 --> 00:04:35,925
Shhh!

62
00:04:35,925 --> 00:04:39,161
- There could've been some misunderstanding...?
- What did I do wrong? Maybe I should just...

63
00:04:39,161 --> 00:04:41,435
- There is no shame in accepting defeat.
- ...call her and ask her what I did wrong. Or maybe..

64
00:04:41,435 --> 00:04:42,612
Here, use this.

65
00:04:42,612 --> 00:04:44,004
Oh... thanks.

66
00:04:45,437 --> 00:04:46,922
Eugh! You can keep it.

67
00:04:46,922 --> 00:04:50,632
By the way, I don't see Rock Crush, Glober, or Blastrain around.

68
00:04:50,632 --> 00:04:52,612
Ah, they went to visit Porcaca.

69
00:04:52,612 --> 00:04:54,091
Are you still keeping in touch with Peruru?

70
00:04:54,091 --> 00:04:56,264
How are those Speranza guys doing?

71
00:04:56,264 --> 00:04:58,798
They seem like they're all doing well and in good spirits.

72
00:04:58,898 --> 00:05:01,464
Don't cry when I win, Red Blitz!

73
00:05:01,464 --> 00:05:05,050
Heh! You think you can beat me when it comes to speed, Spark Bit?

74
00:05:10,367 --> 00:05:14,687
Ugh. They're at it again, even when we have guests from Mowtown.

75
00:05:14,687 --> 00:05:17,002
Right? They never get tired of competing.

76
00:05:17,002 --> 00:05:18,516
I don't even know how many times it's been now.

77
00:05:18,516 --> 00:05:20,170
Why can't they just get along?

78
00:05:20,170 --> 00:05:22,723
Haha! It looks like they're getting along quite nicely to me.

79
00:05:22,723 --> 00:05:23,393
NO.

80
00:05:23,393 --> 00:05:24,430
Whatever the case may be.

81
00:05:24,430 --> 00:05:27,268
Since we're here, how about we make a bet on who'll win?

82
00:05:27,268 --> 00:05:28,009
A bet?

83
00:05:28,009 --> 00:05:29,637
Oh, that sounds interesting.

84
00:05:29,637 --> 00:05:31,158
Red Blitz will win, obviously!

85
00:05:31,158 --> 00:05:34,053
I second that. He seems like he's in a better condition than the other one.

86
00:05:34,254 --> 00:05:37,292
How foolish. My little brother will win no matter what.

87
00:05:37,292 --> 00:05:39,644
I... I can't choose!

88
00:05:39,644 --> 00:05:40,850
Peruru, how abou-

89
00:05:40,850 --> 00:05:43,701
No! You don't have to buy me flowers anymore, Sky Gallop!

90
00:05:43,701 --> 00:05:46,550
O-okay. Just this once. Keep up the good work!

91
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:48,226
Still cherished by her love.

92
00:05:48,427 --> 00:05:51,639
Sigh... huh? Ah, Jun!

93
00:05:51,639 --> 00:05:54,290
Peruru! Are you getting along with the guys who came to visit you?

94
00:05:54,290 --> 00:05:56,223
Yeah! Everyone welcomed them.

95
00:05:56,223 --> 00:05:57,956
They've been asking why you didn't come too.

96
00:05:57,956 --> 00:06:00,244
Haha! I promise I'll visit you soon.

97
00:06:00,944 --> 00:06:03,656
It feels like it was only yesterday when I was staying at your place.

98
00:06:03,656 --> 00:06:05,370
I really miss those days...

99
00:06:07,470 --> 00:06:09,146
- I win!!
- I win!!

100
00:06:09,971 --> 00:06:11,559
No way, idiot! I came in first!

101
00:06:11,559 --> 00:06:12,918
What? You got any proof?!

102
00:06:14,189 --> 00:06:15,644
Boys, stop it!

103
00:06:15,644 --> 00:06:20,100
Mukara's reputation will be ruined if people see the Giants from the Sea of Stars acting so shamefully!

104
00:06:20,699 --> 00:06:22,863
Peruru's Mother speaks the truth!

105
00:06:24,682 --> 00:06:27,545
Stop with your nonsense!!

106
00:06:29,742 --> 00:06:34,261
The Speranza will not be able to leave Earth if you persist with this behavior.

107
00:06:34,261 --> 00:06:35,778
Or, I can always leave you behind!

108
00:06:36,178 --> 00:06:37,829
Don't say something like that, Dad!

109
00:06:38,028 --> 00:06:39,117
Mom!

110
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:41,529
So what, is it a draw?

111
00:06:41,529 --> 00:06:42,855
How disappointing.

112
00:06:42,855 --> 00:06:43,807
Which means...

113
00:06:43,807 --> 00:06:45,622
Rock Crush, looks like you won the bet.

114
00:06:45,622 --> 00:06:46,985
Yahoo!

115
00:06:46,985 --> 00:06:48,372
Heh. Just look at these guys.

116
00:06:48,372 --> 00:06:51,057
Ahaha! They all look like they're doing well.

117
00:06:51,057 --> 00:06:53,928
As noisy as ever, right? How about you guys?

118
00:06:53,928 --> 00:06:55,417
Everyone around here has been busy.

119
00:06:55,417 --> 00:06:56,846
What about Flame Nova?

120
00:07:02,687 --> 00:07:05,374
Blue Cop... I saw it... (FX-italic)

121
00:07:05,374 --> 00:07:07,615
At the lowest level of planet Machina... (FX-italic)

122
00:07:07,615 --> 00:07:10,656
There lies Metal Cardbot's very... first... (FX-italic)

123
00:07:11,555 --> 00:07:13,689
Metal Cardbot! Change Up!

124
00:07:17,411 --> 00:07:19,060
Flame Nova, sealed!

125
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:19,956
Ugh!

126
00:07:20,221 --> 00:07:21,322
Are you okay, Jun?

127
00:07:21,832 --> 00:07:22,867
What happened?

128
00:07:22,867 --> 00:07:26,625
It stung my hand. It felt like he's rejecting me.

129
00:07:27,625 --> 00:07:29,144
I don’t feel anything.

130
00:07:29,144 --> 00:07:30,029
Augh!

131
00:07:33,637 --> 00:07:34,257
Here.

132
00:07:36,766 --> 00:07:38,183
How strange...

133
00:07:38,183 --> 00:07:41,586
I've called out to him several times since then, but he's never answered.

134
00:07:41,586 --> 00:07:44,187
I'm starting to think he may never wake up again...

135
00:07:44,187 --> 00:07:50,348
No way. He'll wake up when he sees that humans and Metal Cardbots are getting along.

136
00:07:50,348 --> 00:07:53,694
I hope he can open up his heart even a little bit, just like Heavy Iron did. 

137
00:07:53,694 --> 00:07:56,483
Yeah, right. Must be why he doesn't bother to show his face.

138
00:07:56,483 --> 00:08:00,271
All he wants to do is work! Such an unsociable fella, that one. 

139
00:08:00,271 --> 00:08:02,346
Now, now, that's all for today!

140
00:08:02,346 --> 00:08:04,620
You guys should go and meet up with the new friends you've made!

141
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:05,882
What? Already?

142
00:08:05,882 --> 00:08:06,942
Get a move on.

143
00:08:06,942 --> 00:08:09,100
We finally get together and this guy gets so heartless...

144
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:11,879
We're no longer a family under one roof to you, huh?

145
00:08:11,879 --> 00:08:13,350
Don't take it out on us just because you got dumped.

146
00:08:13,350 --> 00:08:14,360
SHUT UP!!

147
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:15,821
Well, we can always see each other next time.

148
00:08:15,821 --> 00:08:16,672
See ya later!

149
00:08:17,172 --> 00:08:18,538
What a bummer!

150
00:08:18,538 --> 00:08:20,451
Wild Guardy, let's head out.

151
00:08:20,850 --> 00:08:22,059
See you next week!

152
00:08:23,894 --> 00:08:25,915
Phew! Let's go back home, too.

153
00:08:25,915 --> 00:08:26,478
Mhm!

154
00:08:27,422 --> 00:08:28,613
How's work going?

155
00:08:28,913 --> 00:08:30,855
I'm enforcing parking and speeding violations these days.

156
00:08:30,855 --> 00:08:33,797
It's certainly a lot easier than fighting Metal Cardbots.

157
00:08:33,797 --> 00:08:36,394
Hehehe. There's no job harder than that.

158
00:08:36,695 --> 00:08:38,317
About what Peruru was saying earlier...

159
00:08:38,317 --> 00:08:38,969
Hm?

160
00:08:38,969 --> 00:08:42,788
Let's wait until Flame Nova opens up his heart like she said.

161
00:08:44,989 --> 00:08:45,459
Hm?

162
00:08:52,077 --> 00:08:53,351
Blue Cop! That's...!

163
00:08:58,304 --> 00:08:59,149
Could that be...

164
00:08:59,149 --> 00:08:59,984
Let's go after them!

165
00:08:59,984 --> 00:09:00,798
Roger!

166
00:09:02,701 --> 00:09:05,729
This is Blue Cop. Warning to all who hear this alert.

167
00:09:05,729 --> 00:09:09,042
A suspicious helicopter and a fire truck were spotted in pursuit across the residential area toward the city center.

168
00:09:09,042 --> 00:09:10,554
Report immediately upon sighting.

169
00:09:10,554 --> 00:09:11,669
Could they be Metal Cardbots?

170
00:09:11,669 --> 00:09:14,014
We were just getting back, and now we have to head out again!

171
00:09:19,028 --> 00:09:21,729
Here you go. Thank you for your service as always.

172
00:09:21,729 --> 00:09:22,578
Thank you.

173
00:09:22,578 --> 00:09:23,636
Please come again!

174
00:09:26,912 --> 00:09:28,023
What is that?!

175
00:09:32,625 --> 00:09:36,165
Bzzt! How many times do I have to tell you to stop following me?!

176
00:09:39,509 --> 00:09:41,972
I told you to stay out of trouble, Phantom Hornet!

177
00:09:45,621 --> 00:09:48,719
Goodness... Go fight somewhere else!

178
00:09:48,719 --> 00:09:49,934
I've never seen them before.

179
00:09:49,934 --> 00:09:51,648
Are you sure they haven't met Jun already?

180
00:09:51,648 --> 00:09:53,889
They haven't. I've never seen them before, either.

181
00:09:53,889 --> 00:09:54,426
What?

182
00:09:54,426 --> 00:09:58,114
Our police officers make an effort to memorize every single Metal Cardbot in this city.

183
00:09:58,114 --> 00:10:01,552
This is Vold! Two unidentified Metal Cardbots are facing off on the road in front of the Milky Way diner!

184
00:10:01,552 --> 00:10:04,335
Aaugh! Why does it always have to be at my family's diner?!

185
00:10:04,335 --> 00:10:06,501
If we rush in without thinking, the restaurant could be in trouble!

186
00:10:06,501 --> 00:10:07,625
Mega Ambler here.

187
00:10:07,625 --> 00:10:09,749
Phoenix Fire and I will be arriving at the scene shortly!

188
00:10:10,488 --> 00:10:13,126
Nngh, noisy! The heck!

189
00:10:13,126 --> 00:10:15,336
We'll try to break up the fight. Set me up, please!

190
00:10:15,336 --> 00:10:18,072
Alright! Mega Ambler, set up!

191
00:10:21,458 --> 00:10:22,996
Forceps Crush!

192
00:10:27,957 --> 00:10:31,553
Now, now! Calm down, you're going to startle people with all this commotion!

193
00:10:31,553 --> 00:10:35,519
Bzzt! Calm down?! Why don't YOU calm down!

194
00:10:36,849 --> 00:10:38,937
...you incorrigible idiots!

195
00:10:38,937 --> 00:10:41,280
Can't you see it's not me you should be chasing,

196
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:42,625
but that guy over there?!

197
00:10:56,463 --> 00:10:57,025
Tch!

198
00:11:01,038 --> 00:11:02,478
Mega Ambler, are you okay?

199
00:11:02,778 --> 00:11:03,942
You saw it too, right?

200
00:11:03,942 --> 00:11:05,908
Those eyes... and their Weapon Cards...!

201
00:11:05,908 --> 00:11:07,410
Wait, are you saying they're--?!

202
00:11:07,410 --> 00:11:09,455
Ambly! Fifi! Are you okay?

203
00:11:09,455 --> 00:11:11,493
Unidentified Metal Cardbots are fleeing eastward!

204
00:11:11,493 --> 00:11:13,330
Block the coastal road now!

205
00:11:19,571 --> 00:11:20,639
Blue Cop, set up!

206
00:11:24,556 --> 00:11:26,227
Bzzt-! Augh!!

207
00:11:30,501 --> 00:11:31,320
Freeze!

208
00:11:31,918 --> 00:11:35,273
If you continue to disrupt the peace between Metal Cardbots and humans, we will arrest you!

209
00:11:35,373 --> 00:11:37,562
Be quiet! Eat this and beat it!

210
00:11:39,665 --> 00:11:40,440
Blue Cop!

211
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:41,500
Star Rising Shot!

212
00:11:58,636 --> 00:12:00,104
Veno-Spear!

213
00:12:00,303 --> 00:12:00,774
Jun!

214
00:12:05,410 --> 00:12:06,027
Blue Cop!

215
00:12:11,239 --> 00:12:12,351
What's going on, Blue Cop?!

216
00:12:12,351 --> 00:12:14,500
I don't know... It... burns...!!

217
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:15,229
What?!

218
00:12:21,504 --> 00:12:22,308
Blue Cop!

219
00:12:32,796 --> 00:12:35,183
Wh... what happened to your arm...?!
