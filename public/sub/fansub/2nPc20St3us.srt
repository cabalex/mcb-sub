1
00:00:01,950 --> 00:00:05,346
Pure White Wings, Sky Gallop

2
00:00:07,974 --> 00:00:09,984
That was refreshing! Huh?

3
00:00:09,984 --> 00:00:12,470
Wh-where is it? It's not here!

4
00:00:12,470 --> 00:00:13,422
What's going on?

5
00:00:13,422 --> 00:00:18,518
It's gone! I bought a limited edition caramel pudding flavored ice cream, and it's... 

6
00:00:18,518 --> 00:00:19,492
HEY!!

7
00:00:19,492 --> 00:00:20,379
Sorry.

8
00:00:20,379 --> 00:00:22,870
You jerk!! Get out!!

9
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:23,652
What's going on?!

10
00:00:23,652 --> 00:00:25,411
This is my house!

11
00:00:25,411 --> 00:00:26,954
SHUT UP!!

12
00:00:27,585 --> 00:00:30,786
So... that's why you two have been fighting since last night?

13
00:00:30,786 --> 00:00:34,240
I told you I'll buy you one after I get my allowance!

14
00:00:34,445 --> 00:00:39,109
That's not the point! I wanted to eat that ice cream right after my bath!

15
00:00:39,109 --> 00:00:40,667
You were in the wrong, Jun.

16
00:00:40,667 --> 00:00:42,909
Yeah. I'd be just as mad.

17
00:00:42,909 --> 00:00:44,484
You think I'm the bad guy here?!

18
00:00:44,484 --> 00:00:46,896
I also think it was wrong.

19
00:00:46,896 --> 00:00:49,100
I fourth that too.

20
00:00:49,509 --> 00:00:51,100
And I fifth that.

21
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:56,493
Limited edition ice cream? That's something you can't get, even if you have the money.

22
00:00:56,493 --> 00:00:57,646
Glober!

23
00:00:57,646 --> 00:00:58,790
What are you doing here?!

24
00:00:58,790 --> 00:01:03,500
What a cold welcome. And here I thought I'd share some hot info, fresh outta the oven.

25
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:06,70
Gigantrex?!

26
00:01:06,70 --> 00:01:07,263
Dad!!

27
00:01:07,263 --> 00:01:11,796
This photo was taken a week ago in a jungle, 8000 kilometers away from Mowtown.

28
00:01:11,796 --> 00:01:13,260
8000 kilometers?

29
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:15,557
That's far across the ocean.

30
00:01:15,557 --> 00:01:17,550
How did he get all the way over there?!

31
00:01:17,550 --> 00:01:22,462
What, you haven't heard? There's a rumor about a specialized Metal Cardbot transporter.

32
00:01:22,462 --> 00:01:24,81
A specialized transporter?

33
00:01:25,841 --> 00:01:33,170
Yeah, a professional transporter who can take you anywhere in the world with a single call.

34
00:01:33,170 --> 00:01:35,549
You mean that transporter transported the captain to that jungle?

35
00:01:35,549 --> 00:01:37,560
Could... they be a huge transport plane?

36
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:40,325
So that's why we couldn't find Dad anywhere!

37
00:01:40,325 --> 00:01:42,383
Professional transporter...

38
00:01:43,182 --> 00:01:43,890
What's your deal?!

39
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:44,515
You tell me!

40
00:01:44,515 --> 00:01:47,402
Fighting is prohibited in my car center.

41
00:01:47,402 --> 00:01:52,378
Providing a transportation service must mean there are more Metal Cardbots out there asking for that service.

42
00:01:52,378 --> 00:01:56,709
Yeah. There are quite a few Hidden Cardbots living in hiding like me.

43
00:01:56,709 --> 00:01:57,930
Hidden Cardbots?

44
00:01:57,930 --> 00:01:59,704
Hidden Cardbots...

45
00:02:00,191 --> 00:02:01,406
Why are you copying me?!

46
00:02:01,406 --> 00:02:03,701
You're the one who's copying me, 'cause you have nothing original to say!

47
00:02:03,701 --> 00:02:05,461
You wanna be kicked out?

48
00:02:05,461 --> 00:02:09,436
Glober, I'd like to ask this transporter some questions. Can you help us?

49
00:02:09,436 --> 00:02:14,530
No problem, but... This one's a bit sensitive, so be careful.

50
00:02:32,284 --> 00:02:36,461
My name is Sky Gallop, the pure white wings that fly amongst the heavens.

51
00:02:36,461 --> 00:02:38,639
Is't thou whom bid me?

52
00:02:38,639 --> 00:02:40,983
I was just asked to call ya.

53
00:02:40,983 --> 00:02:44,512
We're the ones who have business with you! We'd like to ask you something-

54
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:46,668
WAAAHHHH!!

55
00:02:46,929 --> 00:02:48,644
WHAT THE HECK ARE YOU DOING?!

56
00:02:48,644 --> 00:02:54,901
How dare a savage human speak to me... I have no intention of conversing with humans.

57
00:02:54,901 --> 00:02:58,564
Wait! Why won't you talk to humans?

58
00:03:00,663 --> 00:03:03,229
It would be against my chivalry...

59
00:03:07,308 --> 00:03:09,263
...to shun a lady's question.

60
00:03:12,740 --> 00:03:15,671
To the question of why I shan't speak to humans... 

61
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:21,381
I shall answer that for you... my fair little lady.

62
00:03:21,867 --> 00:03:23,313
What a weirdo...

63
00:03:23,313 --> 00:03:25,360
I'm reminded of Fleta Z a little bit...

64
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:28,533
The answer is simple. I hate humans.

65
00:03:28,533 --> 00:03:30,444
You hate humans?

66
00:03:30,444 --> 00:03:34,471
I would normally never continue this conversation, yet it would be against my chivalry to ignore a lady's que-

67
00:03:34,471 --> 00:03:36,731
Ah- okay, okay, I get it...!

68
00:03:38,743 --> 00:03:42,638
Very well. So, it befell me when I had only just arrived on this planet.

69
00:03:44,135 --> 00:03:48,703
To the aircraft of unknown nationality: identify yourself immediately, or we will engage!

70
00:03:56,521 --> 00:03:57,533
How impertinent!

71
00:03:58,788 --> 00:04:00,133
Wh-what the?!

72
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:06,0
Such savagery!

73
00:04:09,70 --> 00:04:12,909
This is the scar from that incident. I kept it so as not to forget.

74
00:04:12,909 --> 00:04:14,777
So that's why...

75
00:04:14,777 --> 00:04:18,915
I'm sorry, Sky Gallop. I want to apologize on behalf of all humans.

76
00:04:20,608 --> 00:04:21,927
What is thy name?

77
00:04:21,927 --> 00:04:22,956
I'm Peruru.

78
00:04:22,956 --> 00:04:28,199
Oh, Peruru! My heart is being swept away by thy kindness!

79
00:04:28,473 --> 00:04:31,978
So Cardbots can shed tears too? Oh! My handkerchief!

80
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:36,29
What are you doing?!

81
00:04:36,29 --> 00:04:37,627
Uh-oh! Sorry!

82
00:04:38,218 --> 00:04:39,942
You totally did that on purpose!

83
00:04:39,942 --> 00:04:44,391
Don't be like that. And you can always wash it, you know.

84
00:04:44,391 --> 00:04:46,800
You definitely did that on purpose, Jun.

85
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:49,286
You basically trampled on her heart.

86
00:04:49,286 --> 00:04:50,994
You guys are making me out to be the bad guy again!

87
00:04:50,994 --> 00:04:52,507
Jun. Argue later.

88
00:04:52,507 --> 00:04:55,869
Right. Do you know anything about this guy?

89
00:04:56,726 --> 00:04:59,749
I am a professional. It is my duty to maintain complete client confidentiality.

90
00:04:59,749 --> 00:05:02,199
You said client. Wouldn't that mean you transported him?

91
00:05:02,199 --> 00:05:04,50
Let the cat out of the bag on that one.

92
00:05:04,50 --> 00:05:06,785
Goodness, forbear with thy irritating noises...

93
00:05:07,976 --> 00:05:12,288
Th-that is the treasure of Deus Machina. Why does a mere human have it?

94
00:05:12,288 --> 00:05:13,956
Sky Gallop, I challenge you!

95
00:05:13,956 --> 00:05:14,858
Huh?!

96
00:05:14,858 --> 00:05:15,954
Pardon?

97
00:05:15,954 --> 00:05:20,353
It's a duel! If I win, you'll tell me everything you know!

98
00:05:20,353 --> 00:05:27,180
Ah. He intends to ask not only for information about Gigantrex, but about all the Hidden Cardbots they've been moving around as well.

99
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:29,129
He's really taking on a lot.

100
00:05:29,129 --> 00:05:29,879
I decline.

101
00:05:29,879 --> 00:05:32,225
Huh? W-Why?

102
00:05:32,225 --> 00:05:36,159
A duel with a mere human being. The utterance alone hurts my pride.

103
00:05:36,159 --> 00:05:38,733
Hah. It's obvious you're just backing out because you're afraid of losing.

104
00:05:38,733 --> 00:05:39,677
What?!

105
00:05:39,677 --> 00:05:42,303
If it's a challenge of the sky, it's my time to shine. Jun!

106
00:05:43,646 --> 00:05:49,167
You've been acting all pompous, so I thought we should put those words to the test.

107
00:05:49,167 --> 00:05:53,855
Hmph! 'Tis not chivalrous to dodge a challenge when thou hast been issued one. 

108
00:05:53,855 --> 00:05:56,461
I shall accept this duel!

109
00:05:56,461 --> 00:05:57,971
You got this, Cielo!

110
00:05:59,959 --> 00:06:01,536
Can I ride with you?

111
00:06:01,536 --> 00:06:02,541
Eh??

112
00:06:02,541 --> 00:06:03,584
May I bid thee why?

113
00:06:03,584 --> 00:06:08,309
Duels are meant to be fought on equal terms. And... 

114
00:06:08,309 --> 00:06:10,846
I want revenge for my ice cream!

115
00:06:10,846 --> 00:06:12,394
Oh, Peruru...

116
00:06:12,394 --> 00:06:13,920
A bit excessive...

117
00:06:18,901 --> 00:06:22,810
You sure about this, Peruru? You've never flown before.

118
00:06:22,810 --> 00:06:24,242
You've only flown once!

119
00:06:24,242 --> 00:06:25,839
Th-three times!

120
00:06:25,839 --> 00:06:28,927
Jun! If we win, you're buying me 10 cartons of ice cream!

121
00:06:28,927 --> 00:06:33,404
What?! Ten?! That'll cost all of my allowance! 

122
00:06:33,404 --> 00:06:36,947
And there's no point in us being here if you win!

123
00:06:36,947 --> 00:06:39,935
I'm done arguing with you! Let's go, Sky Gallop!

124
00:06:49,771 --> 00:06:52,875
Sky Gallop is lightning fast for a transport aircraft!

125
00:06:52,875 --> 00:06:56,571
They've been through many battlefields to get here.

126
00:06:56,571 --> 00:07:00,666
The nickname "Pure White Wings" is proof that they've never been shot down.

127
00:07:00,666 --> 00:07:02,961
Pure white? But those wings are black and white...

128
00:07:04,892 --> 00:07:06,254
Now, Cielo!

129
00:07:09,211 --> 00:07:10,456
Missiles incoming!

130
00:07:10,456 --> 00:07:11,685
This is nothing.

131
00:07:15,932 --> 00:07:17,134
They blocked it?!

132
00:07:17,134 --> 00:07:20,749
Looks like Jun doesn't even care that I'm inside here... 

133
00:07:20,749 --> 00:07:22,764
Sky Gallop! Let's repay him in kind with missiles!

134
00:07:22,764 --> 00:07:23,718
It shall be done!

135
00:07:28,370 --> 00:07:29,319
Shoot.

136
00:07:29,319 --> 00:07:31,184
Cielo! Use Skyjet Shot!

137
00:07:31,184 --> 00:07:32,661
You serious? But that'll mean-

138
00:07:32,661 --> 00:07:33,918
Just do it!

139
00:07:39,321 --> 00:07:40,584
Skyjet Shot!

140
00:07:42,192 --> 00:07:44,127
What the-? Is he out of his mind?!

141
00:07:45,398 --> 00:07:47,350
Counterattack! Homing Magnum!

142
00:07:47,350 --> 00:07:48,709
Homing Magnum!

143
00:07:51,903 --> 00:07:53,340
It seems those bullets are guided.

144
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:54,504
Use your flares again!

145
00:07:54,504 --> 00:07:55,884
I can't use them right now.

146
00:08:08,521 --> 00:08:10,434
Sky Gallop! Raise your altitude!

147
00:08:14,963 --> 00:08:17,184
Sky Gallop, do you have any weapons left?

148
00:08:17,184 --> 00:08:19,754
I do, however using them could put thee in danger.

149
00:08:19,754 --> 00:08:21,425
I'll be fine. Attack them!

150
00:08:21,425 --> 00:08:22,228
Very well!

151
00:08:24,785 --> 00:08:28,79
Looks like they're plotting their next move. Cielo, be careful!

152
00:08:28,79 --> 00:08:29,838
Don't worry about me!

153
00:08:35,982 --> 00:08:37,677
Saber Arrow!

154
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:49,518
Wait here!

155
00:08:51,479 --> 00:08:55,809
Thou art persistent. I shall end this now. Peruru?

156
00:08:55,943 --> 00:08:56,788
Pardon me.

157
00:08:59,793 --> 00:09:01,666
Now, allow us to settle the score!

158
00:09:03,187 --> 00:09:04,615
You think that'll work on me again?

159
00:09:08,993 --> 00:09:10,501
I shall reveal to thee...

160
00:09:11,302 --> 00:09:14,211
the true form of the pure white wings!

161
00:09:20,970 --> 00:09:23,150
All I see is a bigger target!

162
00:09:23,150 --> 00:09:24,749
Then just try to hit me!

163
00:09:26,618 --> 00:09:29,807
Cielo! They still can't outmaneuver your speed!

164
00:09:29,807 --> 00:09:31,599
You're the champion of the sky, after all!

165
00:09:31,599 --> 00:09:32,540
You got that right!

166
00:09:45,713 --> 00:09:46,519
Cielo!

167
00:09:58,431 --> 00:09:59,889
You're not getting away this time!

168
00:10:20,697 --> 00:10:23,239
Proxima... Break!!

169
00:10:25,671 --> 00:10:27,471
Victory shall be mine!

170
00:10:27,471 --> 00:10:29,870
Saber Arrow Alpha!!

171
00:10:36,149 --> 00:10:37,145
Cielo!!

172
00:10:43,695 --> 00:10:44,898
Sorry, Jun.

173
00:10:44,898 --> 00:10:46,258
Cielo! Are you alright?!

174
00:10:46,258 --> 00:10:48,634
Because of me, you'll have to spend all your allowance.

175
00:10:48,634 --> 00:10:50,110
I don't care about my allowance!

176
00:10:50,110 --> 00:10:53,971
We won. Don't forget about my 10 cartons of ice cream.

177
00:10:55,354 --> 00:10:56,941
I lost...

178
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:01,657
I had such an enjoyable flight with thee, my fair lady Peruru.

179
00:11:01,657 --> 00:11:04,457
Yeah! Because of you, I was able to get my revenge. Thank you!

180
00:11:04,457 --> 00:11:06,857
And you can just call me Peruru.

181
00:11:06,857 --> 00:11:10,999
Very well, Peruru. I look forward to seeing thee again in the near future.

182
00:11:10,999 --> 00:11:13,822
Ah, and you, filthy adventurer.

183
00:11:13,822 --> 00:11:15,200
F-filthy?

184
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,976
Thou art forever banned from my transportation services.

185
00:11:17,976 --> 00:11:18,831
Drat-!

186
00:11:20,125 --> 00:11:24,234
Sky Gallop... They weren't bluffing. They really are strong.

187
00:11:24,234 --> 00:11:26,393
We had no luck this time...

188
00:11:26,393 --> 00:11:28,190
I wouldn't say that.

189
00:11:28,190 --> 00:11:33,245
Word of you guys will surely spread among the Hidden Cardbots through Sky Gallop. 

190
00:11:33,245 --> 00:11:37,788
I wonder what the other bots on Earth will think of you?
