00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:03,992
[The Revival of Flame Nova]
It is time for me to return... to my true form!

2
00:00:25,129 --> 00:00:32,362
You have my thanks, Gigantrex. I've got my body back thanks to you.

3
00:00:32,463 --> 00:00:35,209
Is that... Flame Nova?!

4
00:00:35,209 --> 00:00:36,625
Wait, you know this guy?

5
00:00:36,625 --> 00:00:37,911
Is that his...

6
00:00:37,911 --> 00:00:39,420
...true form?

7
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:40,871
Give Peruru back!

8
00:00:40,871 --> 00:00:45,798
Are you talking about this child? If you want it back, then you'll have to take it by force!

9
00:00:46,307 --> 00:00:46,999
Hey!

10
00:00:46,999 --> 00:00:47,932
Red Blitz!

11
00:00:47,932 --> 00:00:49,789
No! You can't fight him like this!

12
00:00:50,844 --> 00:00:52,630
Red Blitz! Set-!

13
00:00:52,862 --> 00:00:54,511
Peruru!!!

14
00:00:58,253 --> 00:00:59,451
Everyone, get out of here!

15
00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:00,655
This way!

16
00:01:00,755 --> 00:01:02,481
Rock Crush, keep our friends safe.

17
00:01:02,481 --> 00:01:03,176
O-okay!

18
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:10,784
Oh, looks like you still have the strength to fight.

19
00:01:10,784 --> 00:01:16,188
I can see why Deus Machina entrusted you with the Speranza. However!

20
00:01:17,954 --> 00:01:19,795
It's time for you to retire!

21
00:01:31,763 --> 00:01:35,395
Flame... Impact!

22
00:01:41,527 --> 00:01:42,831
Huh? It's back on!

23
00:01:42,831 --> 00:01:44,691
Where the heck is my daughter?!

24
00:01:44,691 --> 00:01:46,807
I-I think it's... Oh! Editor-in-chief!

25
00:01:47,286 --> 00:01:48,400
I'm sorry!

26
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:50,359
Are we sure this is the port where Jun is?

27
00:01:50,359 --> 00:01:52,222
We can't just sit around! Hurry!

28
00:01:52,222 --> 00:01:53,828
H-hey! Honey! Look!

29
00:01:57,400 --> 00:02:01,352
I'm sorry to have to do this to my savior, Gigantrex. 

30
00:02:01,352 --> 00:02:02,804
But thanks to you...

31
00:02:02,804 --> 00:02:08,854
I now possess an army of two billion Metal Cardbots, sleeping in the depths of the ocean along with the Speranza!

32
00:02:08,854 --> 00:02:10,253
T-two billion?!

33
00:02:10,253 --> 00:02:11,574
Tch... That son of a-!

34
00:02:11,774 --> 00:02:13,372
What are you going to do with them?!

35
00:02:13,372 --> 00:02:15,111
You ask such an obvious question.

36
00:02:15,111 --> 00:02:20,852
I'm going to have them wipe out the human population of this planet, and then I will build my kingdom of Metal Cardbots!

37
00:02:20,852 --> 00:02:21,764
What?!

38
00:02:21,764 --> 00:02:22,860
A kingdom of...

39
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:24,131
Metal Cardbots?!

40
00:02:24,131 --> 00:02:24,992
What?!

41
00:02:25,627 --> 00:02:28,170
Stop talking nonsense, will you?!

42
00:02:28,170 --> 00:02:31,283
I've heard enough about conquering Earth and all that! 

43
00:02:31,283 --> 00:02:32,597
As long as we're here...

44
00:02:32,597 --> 00:02:35,400
...we won't let you do whatever you want!

45
00:02:39,697 --> 00:02:42,134
Heh! Those guys barely got out alive...

46
00:02:42,134 --> 00:02:43,694
...and yet they still have some nerve.

47
00:02:43,694 --> 00:02:45,560
And what about you two?

48
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:48,191
I'll follow you! I like a strong guy.

49
00:02:48,191 --> 00:02:51,521
Not to mention, you have the treasure of Deus Machina now.

50
00:02:51,521 --> 00:02:52,872
I too shall follow.

51
00:02:52,872 --> 00:02:56,247
Hahaha... It's reassuring to know you'll be joining me.

52
00:02:56,247 --> 00:03:00,140
I merely wish to see how this all ends.

53
00:03:00,860 --> 00:03:03,508
Very well. So long, for now.

54
00:03:05,298 --> 00:03:06,324
Wait!

55
00:03:11,854 --> 00:03:14,164
Ugh. You're a total mess.

56
00:03:14,164 --> 00:03:18,848
- The device is tattered and the spindle is warped.
- Just what is going on?! Jun! Are you hurt? Let me have a look!-

57
00:03:18,848 --> 00:03:20,252
- Can we fix him? 
- Daaaaaad!

58
00:03:20,252 --> 00:03:21,543
- Of course we can.
- Daaaaaad!

59
00:03:21,543 --> 00:03:24,289
No one can use the Metal Breath except for it's chosen owner.

60
00:03:24,289 --> 00:03:27,436
But I never considered the Metal Breath and its owner being stolen at the same time.

61
00:03:27,436 --> 00:03:28,786
Will Peruru be alright?

62
00:03:29,186 --> 00:03:31,953
His name was Flame Nova, right? Who exactly is he?

63
00:03:32,151 --> 00:03:33,155
I don't know!

64
00:03:33,155 --> 00:03:35,36
He wasn't part of our crew.

65
00:03:35,36 --> 00:03:37,185
So he was with Sky Gallop and those brothers all along?!

66
00:03:37,185 --> 00:03:40,250
Flame Nova was... my superior on planet Machina.

67
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:41,307
What?!

68
00:03:41,307 --> 00:03:44,174
That would mean he was a Star Guardian too!

69
00:03:44,174 --> 00:03:48,489
He was a valiant Metal Cardbot who was a three-time recipient of the Machina Cross. 

70
00:03:48,489 --> 00:03:52,176
But one day, he suddenly rebelled against Deus Machina. 

71
00:03:52,176 --> 00:03:56,637
He broke into the sanctuary of planet Machina in an attempt to steal the memory core of Deus Machina.

72
00:03:56,637 --> 00:03:59,779
ENTERING THE SANCTUARY IS A CAPITAL OFFENSE. (FX-italic)

73
00:03:59,779 --> 00:04:04,322
THEREFORE, I WILL SEPARATE YOUR BODY AND SEAL IT SO IT CAN NEVER BE RECOMBINED. (FX-italic)

74
00:04:04,917 --> 00:04:07,520
He was sealed AND got his body separated?!

75
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:10,134
That goes to show how serious the crime he committed was.

76
00:04:10,134 --> 00:04:13,709
But I thought he died when planet Machina collapsed.

77
00:04:13,9 --> 00:04:18,394
I cannot believe that such a felon survived and came all the way to this planet to hijack our ship.

78
00:04:18,394 --> 00:04:22,543
Inside the Speranza, two billion of our people sleep in the form of Metal Cards.

79
00:04:22,543 --> 00:04:25,201
- If those Cards fall into the hands of Flame Nova...
- H-how much is 2 billion...?

80
00:04:25,201 --> 00:04:27,817
- It's only a matter of time before the Earth is conquered by them!
- H-how much is 2 billion...?

81
00:04:27,817 --> 00:04:28,796
- Is there any way to stop him?

82
00:04:28,796 --> 00:04:30,576
- Is there any way to stop him?
- Excuse me, Mr. Theo? A moment, please.

83
00:04:30,576 --> 00:04:31,954
- There is one way.
- Excuse me, Mr. Theo? A moment, please.

84
00:04:31,954 --> 00:04:32,629
Really?!

85
00:04:32,629 --> 00:04:33,824
Please tell us, Gigantrex.

86
00:04:33,824 --> 00:04:36,790
By retrieving the Speranza before they get it in the air.

87
00:04:36,790 --> 00:04:39,781
But they stole the Organizer too!

88
00:04:39,781 --> 00:04:43,473
Don't worry! I can fly to Porcaca in no time!

89
00:04:43,473 --> 00:04:46,603
Cielo, we can't fly like you.

90
00:04:46,603 --> 00:04:47,798
Ah...

91
00:04:47,798 --> 00:04:49,947
You're too impatient.

92
00:04:49,947 --> 00:04:51,523
Speak for yourself...

93
00:04:51,523 --> 00:04:54,552
I believe we may have a solution to this problem!

94
00:04:54,552 --> 00:04:56,108
A solution??

95
00:04:56,761 --> 00:04:58,302
Wait, this is...

96
00:04:58,302 --> 00:05:00,495
We can just put them all on here and go!

97
00:05:00,495 --> 00:05:01,637
Hehe, that's right!

98
00:05:01,637 --> 00:05:06,180
Once we connect these vehicle transport containers, we can fly all the way to Porcaca together.

99
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:08,109
How did you get all of these, anyway?

100
00:05:08,109 --> 00:05:12,598
Ahem. I am how! I bought some old, unused containers.

101
00:05:12,598 --> 00:05:15,435
Uncle, is your wallet okay these days?

102
00:05:15,435 --> 00:05:17,884
Master Crest paid for them.

103
00:05:17,884 --> 00:05:20,59
I'm just glad I can help like this.

104
00:05:20,59 --> 00:05:22,129
Can we really cross the ocean with these?

105
00:05:22,129 --> 00:05:26,822
Do not worry! My interdimensional rails can take us anywhere.

106
00:05:26,822 --> 00:05:28,48
Are you sure about that?

107
00:05:28,48 --> 00:05:29,677
O-of course!

108
00:05:30,177 --> 00:05:31,625
He is a dependable fellow.

109
00:05:31,625 --> 00:05:33,182
Then, let's go now!

110
00:05:33,182 --> 00:05:34,384
Dibs on front seat!

111
00:05:34,384 --> 00:05:35,879
Hey! You can just fly!

112
00:05:35,879 --> 00:05:38,129
I've never flown in the sky before!

113
00:05:38,129 --> 00:05:40,168
I guess it'll be a bit like swimming in the ocean.

114
00:05:40,168 --> 00:05:43,650
Good, good. It's great to have a bunch of big behemoths for this job.

115
00:05:43,650 --> 00:05:48,134
Let's get started! First we move these over- Hey-hey-hey, you! Last behemoth! Come here and help us! Chop chop!

116
00:05:48,134 --> 00:05:50,909
W-what's that? Are you talking about me?

117
00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:53,26
...Guys, wait a minute. 

118
00:05:53,26 --> 00:05:58,983
I don't have the Metal Breath anymore. You don't have to follow my orders now. So...

119
00:05:58,983 --> 00:06:00,632
That doesn't sound like you.

120
00:06:00,632 --> 00:06:02,375
Gigantrex...

121
00:06:02,375 --> 00:06:04,206
What are you saying all of a sudden, Jun?

122
00:06:04,206 --> 00:06:07,860
We've been fighting side by side all along. I don't want to just sit back and watch from the sidelines!

123
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:10,39
Heh, heh! Well said, kid!

124
00:06:10,39 --> 00:06:14,281
And you said that the Speranza is at the bottom of the sea. That means you'll need my help.

125
00:06:14,281 --> 00:06:17,646
We do not want them to steal the Speranza away. And most of all...

126
00:06:17,646 --> 00:06:18,911
We need to save Peruru.

127
00:06:18,911 --> 00:06:21,603
If we don't, Mukara will never forgive us.

128
00:06:21,603 --> 00:06:23,169
We'll go with you, too.

129
00:06:23,169 --> 00:06:25,240
Yeah! Let's go save Peruru!

130
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:27,708
And we've got to pick up the kids who can't get home.

131
00:06:28,910 --> 00:06:32,661
Even without the Metal Breath, you and I are connected by the bonds of friendship.

132
00:06:37,610 --> 00:06:40,882
Let's go, guys. Let's put a stop to Flame Nova's plans!

133
00:06:40,882 --> 00:06:42,629
Let's go!!

134
00:06:43,948 --> 00:06:46,673
Haha, Blue Cop! You're really excited aren't ya- Huh?

135
00:06:51,487 --> 00:06:52,725
Alright, line up!

136
00:06:56,182 --> 00:06:57,340
Dad?

137
00:07:02,382 --> 00:07:05,197
So this is the Speranza that Gigantrex and his crew traveled in.

138
00:07:05,197 --> 00:07:08,399
The heck? This place is boring! It just smells like a whole bunch of mold.

139
00:07:08,399 --> 00:07:11,620
'Tis only natural as the ship has been left unattended to for 4,000 years.

140
00:07:14,550 --> 00:07:19,139
We need to find the engine room first. Our first priority is to power this ship.

141
00:07:23,925 --> 00:07:26,584
Peruru. Peruru! Wake up!

142
00:07:26,584 --> 00:07:28,661
Huh?! Wh... Where am I?

143
00:07:28,661 --> 00:07:32,677
We're in the Speranza. Well, we're in the body of that fire truck guy, to be exact.

144
00:07:32,677 --> 00:07:34,504
Glober?! When did you get in here?

145
00:07:34,504 --> 00:07:37,584
Well, my back hurts a little, so I'm letting myself rest up a bit in here.

146
00:07:37,584 --> 00:07:41,466
But that's not important. We'll be in big trouble if we stay in here. We gotta get away!

147
00:07:41,466 --> 00:07:43,747
How? You said we're in Flame Nova's body.

148
00:07:43,747 --> 00:07:46,138
Hehehe. And we'll use that to our advantage!

149
00:07:47,341 --> 00:07:48,715
Is this the engine room?

150
00:07:49,216 --> 00:07:54,200
They used whole, high-purity Machinasium as a battery to power the ship... 

151
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:55,983
Such ignorance.

152
00:07:57,584 --> 00:07:59,846
The power is off. We need to check the circuit-

153
00:07:59,846 --> 00:08:01,415
Glober! Set Up!

154
00:08:01,415 --> 00:08:02,302
What's going on?

155
00:08:02,302 --> 00:08:03,884
The kid used the Metal Breath!

156
00:08:03,884 --> 00:08:05,739
Get m'lady out! Now!!

157
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,526
You rat!

158
00:08:09,865 --> 00:08:11,250
Cutter Whip!

159
00:08:15,826 --> 00:08:17,528
The Metal Breath!

160
00:08:17,528 --> 00:08:19,258
We gotta run away first!

161
00:08:21,646 --> 00:08:22,997
Heh! You think you can get away?

162
00:08:22,997 --> 00:08:26,382
Wait. That girl is no longer useful to us.

163
00:08:28,783 --> 00:08:32,214
The recent suspicious events in this city... 

164
00:08:32,214 --> 00:08:34,245
You were at the heart of it, Jun!

165
00:08:34,245 --> 00:08:37,138
Dad, We're doing this for both the Metal Cardbots and humanity-

166
00:08:37,138 --> 00:08:39,43
Stay out of this, Anna! 

167
00:08:39,43 --> 00:08:41,695
I know you only want to protect them.

168
00:08:41,695 --> 00:08:44,421
However, I also have a duty to protect my citizens! 

169
00:08:44,421 --> 00:08:46,947
We'll take care of the Metal Cardbots now!

170
00:08:46,947 --> 00:08:47,735
Mr. Mayor!!

171
00:08:49,346 --> 00:08:51,161
Nooo!!!

172
00:08:52,787 --> 00:08:55,461
Metal Cardbots are our friends!

173
00:08:55,461 --> 00:08:57,138
That's right!!

174
00:08:57,138 --> 00:08:58,975
They've all been good friends to us!

175
00:08:58,975 --> 00:09:03,774
Mr. Mayor, please listen to these kids! Violence solves nothing!

176
00:09:03,774 --> 00:09:08,764
Anna's father. If you're going to threaten Jun and his friends, then I won't step aside even one inch!

177
00:09:08,764 --> 00:09:11,625
I will not hear this any longer! Get out of the way!

178
00:09:12,774 --> 00:09:15,312
Heeey, I've got a really nice picture!

179
00:09:15,312 --> 00:09:19,451
The title is... Lemme think... "Police units and the mayor subdue children!"

180
00:09:19,451 --> 00:09:20,316
You!

181
00:09:20,316 --> 00:09:25,149
You might think that the Metal Cardbots are a threat if you only watch the news. 

182
00:09:25,149 --> 00:09:31,225
But... While there's one bot that likes to cause trouble, they have a lot of passion. There's a cowardly bot that is kinder than anyone else. 

183
00:09:31,225 --> 00:09:35,308
Metal Cardbots are just like us. They're all different, and there are more good guys than bad! 

184
00:09:35,308 --> 00:09:38,167
So, don't you dare hurt my friends!

185
00:09:38,167 --> 00:09:40,658
Friends? Those Metal Cardbots are your friends?

186
00:09:40,658 --> 00:09:44,722
Dad. You taught me to be nice to everyone.

187
00:09:44,722 --> 00:09:48,186
And you also taught me to reach out to help a friend in need.

188
00:09:48,186 --> 00:09:51,324
Metal Cardbots are our friends in need!

189
00:09:51,324 --> 00:09:55,663
And we don't have much time! We need to go save our other friends! Right now!

190
00:09:55,663 --> 00:09:56,936
Go? Where are you going?

191
00:09:56,936 --> 00:10:02,974
The train to Porcaca will be departing soon. If you wish to board, please hurry.

192
00:10:02,974 --> 00:10:06,90
Mr. Mayor. We will come back no matter what.

193
00:10:06,90 --> 00:10:10,206
And when we come back, please tell us whether humanity can trust us or not.

194
00:10:12,777 --> 00:10:17,235
Very well. Please take care of Anna. And please come back safely.

195
00:10:17,235 --> 00:10:18,79
We will!

196
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:22,293
That should do it.

197
00:10:22,293 --> 00:10:25,552
Tie me tighter! I don't want him to put a hole in my butt!

198
00:10:25,552 --> 00:10:26,913
That's why I asked if you wanted to change seats...

199
00:10:26,913 --> 00:10:27,529
Never!

200
00:10:27,529 --> 00:10:29,947
Captain, tell me if you start to have a headache again, alright?

201
00:10:29,947 --> 00:10:30,773
I will.

202
00:10:31,283 --> 00:10:32,480
Jun!

203
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:34,750
Mom! What's all this?

204
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:39,918
Some food for the trip. I can't let you go empty-handed when you're out doing something great, right?

205
00:10:39,918 --> 00:10:41,440
Be careful out there.

206
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:42,240
Mom...

207
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:45,369
Tell Peruru that I'll make some for her when she comes back.

208
00:10:45,369 --> 00:10:46,350
Okay!

209
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:48,351
Excuse me!! 

210
00:10:48,351 --> 00:10:51,153
Lemme- Lemme go with you!!

211
00:10:51,153 --> 00:10:52,287
Mr. Jim?

212
00:10:52,787 --> 00:10:55,487
It's not that I'm greedy for a scoop...!

213
00:10:55,487 --> 00:11:01,388
...well, maybe a little bit, but as a journalist, I want to tell the world the truth about Metal Cardbots!

214
00:11:01,388 --> 00:11:03,322
Alright. Welcome aboard!

215
00:11:03,322 --> 00:11:05,658
Speaking of which, I don't see Vera anywhere...

216
00:11:05,658 --> 00:11:09,644
Ah, the editor-in-chief... uh, I mean Vera's dad told her to stay out of trouble.

217
00:11:09,644 --> 00:11:10,576
Ah.

218
00:11:10,899 --> 00:11:13,484
Now then, time to put my skills to work!

219
00:11:13,484 --> 00:11:16,471
The train to Porcaca is now departing!

220
00:11:24,272 --> 00:11:25,643
Have a nice trip!

221
00:11:32,431 --> 00:11:33,879
Take care of yourself!

222
00:11:33,879 --> 00:11:35,211
Come back safe!
