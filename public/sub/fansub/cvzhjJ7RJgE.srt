1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:01,528
A Gift From Mukara

2
00:00:01,528 --> 00:00:04,190
Fight, to realize my ambitions!

3
00:00:16,278 --> 00:00:21,301
Jun! My dad can't fly! I'd attack him from the sky if I were you!

4
00:00:21,301 --> 00:00:23,538
That's right! Blue Cop! You can fly, right?

5
00:00:23,538 --> 00:00:24,419
Of course!

6
00:00:40,453 --> 00:00:44,382
Do not think you can best me just because you can fly!

7
00:00:44,782 --> 00:00:46,781
That's the same device Red Blitz was using!

8
00:00:46,781 --> 00:00:47,969
The Organizer!

9
00:00:47,969 --> 00:00:50,30
I knew the captain had another one...

10
00:00:50,830 --> 00:00:52,97
So that's how he disappeared without a trace back then...

11
00:01:05,822 --> 00:01:07,596
Dad! Stop it!

12
00:01:09,266 --> 00:01:10,825
You haven't seen anything yet!

13
00:01:13,102 --> 00:01:14,229
Huh? Where did he go?

14
00:01:20,836 --> 00:01:21,888
Blue Cop!!

15
00:01:26,428 --> 00:01:27,467
Are you seeing this?!

16
00:01:27,467 --> 00:01:32,505
The battle of Metal Cardbots that goes beyond human logic is unfolding right before my very eyes!

17
00:01:32,505 --> 00:01:33,704
How did it come to this?

18
00:01:33,704 --> 00:01:35,348
I don't know either...

19
00:01:35,348 --> 00:01:38,27
Speranza's teleportation device, the Organizer...

20
00:01:38,27 --> 00:01:40,806
The captain is using its main function as a means of attack!

21
00:01:41,406 --> 00:01:43,144
I said stop, Dad!

22
00:01:43,144 --> 00:01:45,482
If you overuse the Organizer like that, it'll-

23
00:01:45,482 --> 00:01:46,620
SILENCE!!

24
00:01:47,549 --> 00:01:48,754
Red Blitz!

25
00:01:52,12 --> 00:01:53,962
Why would you do that to Red Blitz, Captain?!

26
00:01:54,962 --> 00:01:56,648
Cielo, attack together!

27
00:02:19,831 --> 00:02:21,251
Blastrain! Set Up!

28
00:02:27,341 --> 00:02:28,0
Be careful!

29
00:02:36,847 --> 00:02:37,819
Mr. Blastrain!

30
00:02:37,819 --> 00:02:39,152
Mr. Train!!

31
00:02:41,853 --> 00:02:42,570
Blastrain!!

32
00:02:42,970 --> 00:02:45,169
This is not the time to worry about others!

33
00:02:46,169 --> 00:02:47,791
Blue Cop! Docking Out!

34
00:02:47,791 --> 00:02:48,526
Roger...!

35
00:02:54,181 --> 00:02:55,560
Rush him from all sides!

36
00:03:05,19 --> 00:03:07,820
Get up already, Spark Bit. We need to join him!

37
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:11,975
Ow ow ow... He knocked me out along with the enemy. Is he really on our side?

38
00:03:11,975 --> 00:03:13,781
It's just this once. Endure it.

39
00:03:13,781 --> 00:03:14,761
Guess I have no choice!

40
00:03:15,61 --> 00:03:18,649
Ahoy, there. You'll have to get through me first!

41
00:03:18,649 --> 00:03:20,820
Ignore him, we can go around.

42
00:03:21,991 --> 00:03:23,497
Let me battle you too!

43
00:03:23,497 --> 00:03:26,134
Battle, huh?! That's one of my favorite words!

44
00:03:26,134 --> 00:03:28,360
Sky Gallop, what are you doing...?!

45
00:03:29,333 --> 00:03:30,644
Master Crest, we're here!

46
00:03:30,644 --> 00:03:31,545
Drop us off over there.

47
00:03:31,545 --> 00:03:32,226
Yes sir!

48
00:03:37,248 --> 00:03:37,829
Peruru!

49
00:03:37,829 --> 00:03:38,580
Sky Gallop!!

50
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:41,435
Lady Peruru! What brings you to a dangerous place such as this?

51
00:03:41,435 --> 00:03:43,311
Do we really have to fight like this?

52
00:03:43,311 --> 00:03:46,372
It breaks my heart to be enemies with thee, m'lady.

53
00:03:46,372 --> 00:03:49,433
Yet even when divided, our bond shall be etern-

54
00:03:50,433 --> 00:03:53,965
If we're enemies, we're enemies! I hate this kind of ambiguity you're making!

55
00:03:56,319 --> 00:04:00,295
I have no choice, for I have lost my home. Joined to this land...

56
00:04:01,795 --> 00:04:04,115
My fight must continue forevermore!

57
00:04:12,146 --> 00:04:13,660
Annoying pests!

58
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:14,452
Sir Rex! 

59
00:04:16,552 --> 00:04:17,244
Get on!

60
00:04:20,906 --> 00:04:24,01
'Tis against my chivalry to fight two against one...

61
00:04:24,01 --> 00:04:27,256
Yet there is no freedom for us lest I defeat the Star Guardian!

62
00:04:28,395 --> 00:04:30,670
Blue Cop! Superior Docking!

63
00:04:53,141 --> 00:04:55,870
REX! INFERNO!! (FX-bold phoenixFire)

64
00:04:59,167 --> 00:05:00,250
Blue Cop!

65
00:05:05,672 --> 00:05:06,662
Sir Rex?!

66
00:05:07,581 --> 00:05:08,710
He got overloaded!

67
00:05:08,710 --> 00:05:11,20
Theo! Guys! Over-huh?

68
00:05:11,20 --> 00:05:13,485
Overloaded! It means he's in overdrive!

69
00:05:13,485 --> 00:05:16,690
His circuitry is strained because he overused that device!

70
00:05:16,690 --> 00:05:18,113
I've heard of this before.

71
00:05:18,113 --> 00:05:20,437
An Organizer in overdrive once warped the space around it,

72
00:05:20,437 --> 00:05:22,784
and it blew up an entire town!

73
00:05:22,784 --> 00:05:23,766
What?!

74
00:05:23,766 --> 00:05:25,110
Well that's not good!

75
00:05:26,246 --> 00:05:30,179
An overdriven Organizer wasn't part of my plan...

76
00:05:30,179 --> 00:05:32,512
Now, what are you going to do?

77
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:46,73
Aah, my phone!

78
00:05:49,13 --> 00:05:50,483
This ends-!

79
00:05:50,483 --> 00:05:52,125
NOW!!!

80
00:05:53,113 --> 00:05:54,406
BLUE COP!!!

81
00:06:03,184 --> 00:06:03,999
Peruru...!

82
00:06:04,29 --> 00:06:05,345
My lady?

83
00:06:18,267 --> 00:06:19,888
His eyes...!

84
00:06:23,524 --> 00:06:25,695
You... Weren't you the descendant of Mukara...?

85
00:06:25,695 --> 00:06:28,968
Yes. Mukara is my ancestor.

86
00:06:28,968 --> 00:06:31,482
Right. I remember now.

87
00:06:31,482 --> 00:06:34,795
Mukara is no longer in this world...

88
00:06:34,795 --> 00:06:36,532
Gigantrex!

89
00:06:36,532 --> 00:06:38,427
You're in danger right now!

90
00:06:38,427 --> 00:06:40,31
I'm in danger?

91
00:06:40,31 --> 00:06:42,166
You're gonna explode at this rate!

92
00:06:46,139 --> 00:06:47,283
Agh, it's hot!

93
00:06:47,283 --> 00:06:49,185
Why were you running towards him when you knew it was dangerous?!

94
00:06:49,185 --> 00:06:50,714
It's better to stay away from him.

95
00:06:50,714 --> 00:06:54,17
But... We need to remove that Organizer from him, quickly!

96
00:06:54,17 --> 00:06:56,808
We'll take it from here!!

97
00:06:59,149 --> 00:07:01,699
I'm gonna save my dad for sure!!

98
00:07:09,691 --> 00:07:11,12
He's going for Peruru!

99
00:07:12,812 --> 00:07:15,210
Stop it already, Captain! Please!!

100
00:07:19,417 --> 00:07:20,574
Guys!

101
00:07:22,18 --> 00:07:23,545
Let me lend you a hand!

102
00:07:23,545 --> 00:07:24,327
Us too!

103
00:07:24,327 --> 00:07:26,72
Hold on. Wait for me!

104
00:07:34,577 --> 00:07:36,963
Blue Cop! Cut off the Organizer!!

105
00:07:37,673 --> 00:07:38,978
Hurry!!

106
00:07:38,978 --> 00:07:40,498
We don't have much time until it explodes!

107
00:07:40,498 --> 00:07:42,215
But... What if I fail...?

108
00:07:42,215 --> 00:07:45,340
Think about that some other time!! I'm putting all my faith in ya!

109
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:46,751
I know you can do this!

110
00:07:46,751 --> 00:07:48,920
Save him, just like you saved me!

111
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:50,995
I can't hold on much longer!!

112
00:07:50,995 --> 00:07:51,723
Everyone...

113
00:07:51,723 --> 00:07:52,690
Blue Cop!

114
00:08:01,849 --> 00:08:03,154
Hurry up!!

115
00:08:07,882 --> 00:08:10,235
Please... Save my friend. (FX-italic)

116
00:08:10,335 --> 00:08:11,292
Roger that.

117
00:08:19,663 --> 00:08:20,241
Blue Cop!

118
00:08:22,173 --> 00:08:23,553
Galaxies... (FX-bold blueCop)

119
00:08:26,856 --> 00:08:28,287
Punisher!!! (FX-bold blueShine)

120
00:08:49,923 --> 00:08:51,14
Captain!

121
00:08:51,14 --> 00:08:52,15
Dad!!

122
00:08:52,15 --> 00:08:52,848
Wait!

123
00:08:52,848 --> 00:08:53,816
What?!

124
00:08:53,816 --> 00:08:54,588
Look at his eyes!

125
00:09:06,52 --> 00:09:06,863
Peruru!

126
00:09:24,336 --> 00:09:25,402
Mukara...!

127
00:09:25,402 --> 00:09:26,915
Friends of the Speranza. (FX-italic)

128
00:09:26,915 --> 00:09:30,427
By the time you wake up, I will no longer be in this world. (FX-italic)

129
00:09:30,427 --> 00:09:34,2
But, I hope my descendants will still be with you. (FX-italic)

130
00:09:34,2 --> 00:09:36,470
Please heed my advice and get along with not only my descendants, (FX-italic)

131
00:09:36,470 --> 00:09:39,504
but with everyone on this planet. (FX-italic)

132
00:09:39,504 --> 00:09:40,838
Just as you did with me. (FX-italic)

133
00:09:50,438 --> 00:09:52,313
Peruru... What was that just now?

134
00:09:54,270 --> 00:09:56,4
The head of that spear... 

135
00:09:56,4 --> 00:09:59,538
is a piece of Machinasium I gave to Mukara as a token of our friendship.

136
00:09:59,538 --> 00:10:01,29
D-Dad!

137
00:10:01,29 --> 00:10:01,832
Captain!

138
00:10:01,832 --> 00:10:03,447
Is that Gigantrex's...

139
00:10:03,447 --> 00:10:04,598
...true character?

140
00:10:04,598 --> 00:10:06,423
Machinasium?

141
00:10:06,423 --> 00:10:08,495
It is a kind of metal from the planet Machina.

142
00:10:08,495 --> 00:10:11,230
It can be used to heal the wounds of Metal Cardbots,

143
00:10:11,230 --> 00:10:13,766
and sometimes, it functions as a storage medium.

144
00:10:13,766 --> 00:10:16,576
So... Mukara just saved you!

145
00:10:16,576 --> 00:10:19,614
No. Not just him.

146
00:10:19,614 --> 00:10:23,33
Descendant of Mukara, you saved me as well.

147
00:10:23,33 --> 00:10:24,252
Thank you.

148
00:10:24,252 --> 00:10:28,537
All thanks to the gift from Mukara. And my name is Peruru!

149
00:10:31,137 --> 00:10:32,6
Peruru...

150
00:10:32,606 --> 00:10:33,573
And you.

151
00:10:33,573 --> 00:10:38,141
Musclehyde, Cielo, Red Blitz... Thank you for your hard work. 

152
00:10:38,141 --> 00:10:40,475
All of you, you have my thanks as well.

153
00:10:43,21 --> 00:10:46,306
Peruru, take good care of Gigantrex.

154
00:10:50,417 --> 00:10:51,338
Okay!

155
00:10:55,676 --> 00:10:58,24
Metal Cardbot! Change Up!

156
00:10:58,24 --> 00:10:59,153
Metal Cardbot! Change- Uh?

157
00:11:09,546 --> 00:11:10,514
Peruru!

158
00:11:10,514 --> 00:11:13,426
At last, the Metal Breath is in my grasp!

159
00:11:13,426 --> 00:11:18,1
My power, sealed away by Deus Machina, shall rise again!

160
00:11:34,664 --> 00:11:36,362
No... it can't be...!

161
00:11:36,362 --> 00:11:40,966
It is time for me to return... to my true form!
