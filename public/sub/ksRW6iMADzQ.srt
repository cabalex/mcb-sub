1
00:00:01,735 --> 00:00:04,905
Defeating the Heli-Tornado

2
00:00:08,36 --> 00:00:09,819
It was just a story you made up?!

3
00:00:09,819 --> 00:00:12,775
Yeah! I just said whatever came to me at the time, you know?

4
00:00:12,775 --> 00:00:14,507
But why, Jun?

5
00:00:14,507 --> 00:00:18,235
Oh yeah?! Well, I have a secret weapon that can beat that!

6
00:00:18,235 --> 00:00:20,654
Why did you have to say that!?

7
00:00:20,654 --> 00:00:25,304
It was the only way to get out of that situation...

8
00:00:25,304 --> 00:00:29,132
Don't worry... I'll think of something starting now...

9
00:00:29,132 --> 00:00:31,171
What are you two talking about?

10
00:00:31,171 --> 00:00:32,628
Vera?

11
00:00:32,628 --> 00:00:34,552
It has nothing to do with you.

12
00:00:34,552 --> 00:00:36,120
Oh, really?

13
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:38,516
Then what's this?

14
00:00:41,718 --> 00:00:43,34
Aah!

15
00:00:43,253 --> 00:00:44,267
Mhm.

16
00:00:44,546 --> 00:00:45,725
Here's the thing.

17
00:00:45,725 --> 00:00:48,989
We were filming a dance by the docks of Mowtown,

18
00:00:48,989 --> 00:00:52,775
when we saw robots fighting. And we got it on video.

19
00:00:52,775 --> 00:00:55,472
And we saw you two there.

20
00:00:55,472 --> 00:00:57,796
What's going on?

21
00:00:58,781 --> 00:01:00,671
Uhh... maybe they were guys that looks like us?

22
00:01:00,671 --> 00:01:05,988
That's right! You know they say there are at least three people in this world that looks exactly like you!

23
00:01:07,225 --> 00:01:11,234
Wearing the same clothes, the same hair, and the same shoes?!

24
00:01:11,234 --> 00:01:14,145
You expect me to buy that story?! Really?!

25
00:01:14,145 --> 00:01:15,786
We're busy!! We gotta go!

26
00:01:16,825 --> 00:01:18,772
Hey, stop running!

27
00:01:24,587 --> 00:01:27,452
What do we do? We can't keep running away from them!

28
00:01:27,452 --> 00:01:30,489
We have to figure out how to take that video away from her!

29
00:01:30,489 --> 00:01:34,101
Actually... she could have saved other copies...

30
00:01:34,101 --> 00:01:37,270
If she uploads it on the Internet, there's no turning back!

31
00:01:38,545 --> 00:01:42,469
Don't worry about a thing! I have a very good plan!

32
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:45,987
That just makes me feel worse...

33
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:53,627
Good day everyone.

34
00:01:53,627 --> 00:01:58,159
I would like to talk about the rumors going around regarding a giant robot.

35
00:01:58,159 --> 00:01:59,720
Giant robot?

36
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:01,23
Yeah!

37
00:02:01,23 --> 00:02:03,68
There have been reported sightings of robots in 

38
00:02:03,68 --> 00:02:07,376
waterways, under highways, and flying above the city,

39
00:02:07,376 --> 00:02:10,256
so we would like to... reveal the truth about all these robots!

40
00:02:10,256 --> 00:02:12,172
I'm intrigued right now!

41
00:02:12,172 --> 00:02:15,326
Tune in to our live broadcast this evening at 8!

42
00:02:15,326 --> 00:02:18,674
Remember to subscribe to our channel!

43
00:02:20,33 --> 00:02:22,776
What do you think he's going to say, huh?

44
00:02:22,776 --> 00:02:26,202
I think it may be about that robot we saw last time!

45
00:02:26,202 --> 00:02:27,401
Really?

46
00:02:28,316 --> 00:02:30,398
Oh no, he got us!

47
00:02:30,398 --> 00:02:33,574
I reveal at 8 pm today?! Huh?!

48
00:02:33,574 --> 00:02:37,636
That fool is trying to sabotage the video that we took of the robots!

49
00:02:39,938 --> 00:02:41,888
So tell me... what do we do next?

50
00:02:41,888 --> 00:02:44,489
I'm not sure yet...

51
00:02:44,489 --> 00:02:46,637
Oh no, not again...

52
00:02:46,637 --> 00:02:48,893
Jun! It's all set up.

53
00:02:49,986 --> 00:02:51,903
Woah...

54
00:02:52,718 --> 00:02:55,713
That's awesome! Wow!

55
00:02:55,735 --> 00:02:57,948
It's a jet engine from a plane.

56
00:02:57,948 --> 00:03:02,253
It's been modified so that the wind will be strong enough to blow away a Metal Cardbot.

57
00:03:02,253 --> 00:03:04,810
You're the best, Uncle Edo! That's great!

58
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:06,827
Uh, don't call me uncle! I'm not that old!

59
00:03:06,827 --> 00:03:08,688
But what will you do with this?

60
00:03:08,688 --> 00:03:12,400
A special training, for you to learn how to defeat Shadow X and its tornado!

61
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,949
Ha! Got it, Jun!

62
00:03:13,949 --> 00:03:16,7
Let me have a go first!

63
00:03:23,261 --> 00:03:24,891
Metal Breath, pickup!

64
00:03:26,517 --> 00:03:28,420
Mega Trucker, setup!

65
00:03:45,75 --> 00:03:47,51
Okay, let's begin!

66
00:03:47,51 --> 00:03:50,265
Alright, setting power to 80%...

67
00:03:55,704 --> 00:04:00,716
Mega Trucker will be harder to blow away since he's heavier than Blue Cop, right?

68
00:04:00,716 --> 00:04:02,963
I'm fine with this little breeze...

69
00:04:02,963 --> 00:04:05,4
Power 90%.

70
00:04:11,425 --> 00:04:16,725
Mega Trucker... open your Shoulder Shield! You must hang on!

71
00:04:16,725 --> 00:04:18,529
Shoulder Shield!

72
00:04:22,382 --> 00:04:24,732
Output 100%!

73
00:04:24,732 --> 00:04:26,250
Still doing good!

74
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:28,73
Alright, Mega Trucker!

75
00:04:28,73 --> 00:04:30,935
This could work against Shadow X for sure!

76
00:04:38,307 --> 00:04:39,827
It's Shadow X!

77
00:04:39,827 --> 00:04:44,488
So you guys are training? Should've let me know! I would have helped you!

78
00:04:44,488 --> 00:04:46,804
Augh, this is a rental!

79
00:04:46,804 --> 00:04:49,95
You'll pay for the damages!

80
00:04:49,95 --> 00:04:51,942
That's not my problem! Ha!

81
00:04:51,942 --> 00:04:54,688
Shall we set the score once and for all?

82
00:04:54,688 --> 00:04:57,149
Mega Trucker, show us your power!

83
00:04:59,925 --> 00:05:03,161
That fool from yesterday, huh? Ha!

84
00:05:03,161 --> 00:05:04,579
Spinning Cutter!

85
00:05:10,91 --> 00:05:14,314
Hahaha! You thought I'd come from the front where you have your defenses?

86
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:16,891
Aren't you a real dumbo?

87
00:05:17,761 --> 00:05:19,760
It's not over yet!

88
00:05:19,821 --> 00:05:22,452
Huh? Quite persistent, aren't you?

89
00:05:23,219 --> 00:05:24,359
Gotcha!

90
00:05:25,3 --> 00:05:26,496
Let go of me!

91
00:05:32,436 --> 00:05:35,413
My propeller! How dare you!

92
00:05:38,106 --> 00:05:39,875
Come back, Mega Trucker!

93
00:05:44,596 --> 00:05:47,424
Good job, Mega Trucker. Take a breath.

94
00:05:47,424 --> 00:05:48,557
Jun.

95
00:05:49,190 --> 00:05:50,610
Blue Cop!

96
00:05:50,610 --> 00:05:52,687
Jun. Summon me, please.

97
00:05:52,687 --> 00:05:53,686
But you have to-

98
00:05:53,686 --> 00:05:56,385
I want you to.

99
00:05:56,385 --> 00:05:57,844
Well... alright.

100
00:06:02,401 --> 00:06:04,284
Metal Breath, pickup!

101
00:06:05,635 --> 00:06:07,359
Blue Cop, setup!

102
00:06:27,706 --> 00:06:29,336
Ha! You again?

103
00:06:29,336 --> 00:06:32,815
As long as I need to fight for justice, I will rise up time and time again!

104
00:06:32,815 --> 00:06:35,501
Oh... how heroic!

105
00:06:36,987 --> 00:06:39,163
Shadow X can't fly anymore.

106
00:06:39,163 --> 00:06:42,171
Now's your chance to shoot him!

107
00:06:42,171 --> 00:06:43,110
Alright.

108
00:06:44,627 --> 00:06:48,478
You thought that would stop me from flying? Ha!

109
00:06:55,664 --> 00:06:56,729
No way...

110
00:06:57,264 --> 00:06:59,225
How did he do that...?

111
00:06:59,423 --> 00:07:01,152
Haha! Coming through!

112
00:07:03,926 --> 00:07:05,400
Woah! Not too bad!

113
00:07:05,683 --> 00:07:07,706
Let's make things more interesting!

114
00:07:07,706 --> 00:07:10,549
Heli-Tornado!

115
00:07:21,782 --> 00:07:23,230
Jun! Are you alright?

116
00:07:23,230 --> 00:07:25,116
I'm okay, don't worry!

117
00:07:25,116 --> 00:07:27,990
Just hang in there. Let's get out of here for now.

118
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:30,702
You can do it! Friends trust each other.

119
00:07:34,799 --> 00:07:36,670
Friends...

120
00:07:38,581 --> 00:07:40,553
You've got it, my friend!

121
00:07:40,553 --> 00:07:43,226
Turn into a police car and run laps around him!

122
00:07:43,226 --> 00:07:44,449
Alright!

123
00:07:55,450 --> 00:07:56,884
What is happening now?!

124
00:07:56,884 --> 00:08:00,84
Blue Cop's police car mode has less air resistance,

125
00:08:00,84 --> 00:08:03,34
so it's less affected by the wind!

126
00:08:04,287 --> 00:08:06,232
Stop that now!

127
00:08:08,623 --> 00:08:11,97
Keep going! Faster!

128
00:08:15,152 --> 00:08:17,537
Wha-! Why are you doing this?!

129
00:08:17,826 --> 00:08:21,666
He must consume a lot of energy to create that kind of tornado!

130
00:08:21,666 --> 00:08:23,880
He won't last for long!

131
00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:28,251
His system is overloaded!

132
00:08:28,251 --> 00:08:30,87
Get him now, Blue Cop!

133
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:35,339
Megavolt Punch!

134
00:08:41,552 --> 00:08:43,259
Megavolt...

135
00:08:43,259 --> 00:08:44,650
Punch!

136
00:08:44,650 --> 00:08:46,877
Aaaaah!

137
00:08:56,340 --> 00:09:00,118
No way... my Heli-Tornado...

138
00:09:01,262 --> 00:09:03,178
You did it, Blue Cop!

139
00:09:03,178 --> 00:09:06,421
A true friend is someone who doesn't give up when it gets tough.

140
00:09:06,421 --> 00:09:08,83
Someone you can count on.

141
00:09:08,83 --> 00:09:14,736
Friend? Huh... was that what I didn't have...?

142
00:09:14,736 --> 00:09:16,323
Alright... you win.

143
00:09:16,323 --> 00:09:19,465
I will become your underling now...

144
00:09:23,188 --> 00:09:25,992
Not an underling. You're my friend too.

145
00:09:26,307 --> 00:09:28,269
Sealing complete!

146
00:09:28,269 --> 00:09:29,384
Great job!

147
00:09:29,749 --> 00:09:31,983
But what are you going to do now?

148
00:09:31,983 --> 00:09:33,484
About what?

149
00:09:33,484 --> 00:09:36,812
You forgotten? We're going live in the evening!

150
00:09:38,7 --> 00:09:40,247
Oh no!

151
00:09:45,277 --> 00:09:47,221
Rawr!

152
00:09:47,828 --> 00:09:49,88
Rawr!

153
00:09:49,559 --> 00:09:52,159
Ka-boom!

154
00:09:52,734 --> 00:09:55,471
Hohoho!

155
00:09:58,300 --> 00:09:59,614
Woah!

156
00:10:00,666 --> 00:10:01,589
Take that!

157
00:10:02,749 --> 00:10:05,942
So you see? All the robot sightings were actually made up

158
00:10:05,942 --> 00:10:09,377
using custom made miniatures and special effects!

159
00:10:09,377 --> 00:10:14,839
Hey, hang on! We really saw it! It was a robot as big as a house, just flying at us!

160
00:10:14,839 --> 00:10:16,708
Oh, that?

161
00:10:16,708 --> 00:10:18,497
Well, take a look!

162
00:10:18,497 --> 00:10:24,194
Ahem. This robot is a 1 to 1 scale model made to order by a film studio.

163
00:10:24,194 --> 00:10:26,226
What?! A model?! Huh?!

164
00:10:26,226 --> 00:10:31,532
Of course! It's made of styrofoam, so it's very light, you see? Hehehe...

165
00:10:32,43 --> 00:10:35,35
It was in storage, but it flew away in the wind.

166
00:10:35,35 --> 00:10:36,675
So sorry for the commotion...

167
00:10:37,202 --> 00:10:39,634
So everyone, this was our live broadcast,

168
00:10:39,634 --> 00:10:43,4
"I Saw Mysterious Robots Flying Around the Docks!"

169
00:10:43,4 --> 00:10:45,334
Make sure to turn in to our next episode!

170
00:10:46,649 --> 00:10:48,574
And please remember to subscribe!

171
00:10:49,148 --> 00:10:53,838
Urgh... do you think you would get away with those lies?

172
00:10:53,838 --> 00:10:59,225
I will find the evidence no matter what! You better watch out, Jun!
