1
00:00:01,606 --> 00:00:04,370
Operation Underground Battle

2
00:00:12,312 --> 00:00:14,59
Wow!

3
00:00:15,909 --> 00:00:17,708
It's a drone with a camera!

4
00:00:17,708 --> 00:00:19,270
I got it yesterday.

5
00:00:19,270 --> 00:00:23,688
With this thing, we can find the robot hiding in the forest from a safe distance.

6
00:00:23,688 --> 00:00:25,728
Uh... about that robot...

7
00:00:25,728 --> 00:00:29,796
You lost it, didn't you? I heard from Sebastian.

8
00:00:29,796 --> 00:00:32,525
I... am just glad you're okay though, Crest!

9
00:00:32,525 --> 00:00:34,707
Yeah, we were... so worried!

10
00:00:34,707 --> 00:00:39,449
I think that forest is too dangerous. We better stay away for now... 

11
00:00:39,449 --> 00:00:41,411
Yeah, I agree with Anna...

12
00:00:41,411 --> 00:00:45,710
That robot said it hated humans, though. We can't just ignore it.

13
00:00:45,710 --> 00:00:49,832
I wonder just how much Crest knows about the Metal Cardbots.

14
00:00:50,794 --> 00:00:51,635
Uncle Edo!

15
00:00:51,703 --> 00:00:53,726
He wants the Metal Cardbots...

16
00:00:53,726 --> 00:00:55,40
Let go of him!

17
00:00:56,10 --> 00:00:57,294
Wait up, Crest!

18
00:00:57,662 --> 00:01:01,143
He didn't seem surprised at all...

19
00:01:07,684 --> 00:01:08,623
What's that?!

20
00:01:16,270 --> 00:01:18,49
Mega Ambler? What's the matter?

21
00:01:18,49 --> 00:01:19,373
Jun. It's an emergency.

22
00:01:19,373 --> 00:01:21,513
The pipes burst and water is getting everywhere.

23
00:01:21,513 --> 00:01:22,786
I have no idea how it happened.

24
00:01:33,723 --> 00:01:37,433
There's been a sinkhole here too. I can't handle this by myself!

25
00:01:37,433 --> 00:01:38,831
Somebody come help, please!

26
00:01:38,831 --> 00:01:40,823
Alright. I'll be there right away.

27
00:01:48,925 --> 00:01:50,183
Huh?! What's that?!

28
00:01:53,273 --> 00:01:54,296
Dexter?!

29
00:01:54,859 --> 00:01:55,962
Who is it?!

30
00:01:57,519 --> 00:02:00,174
So you've been causing the sinkholes in Mowtown!

31
00:02:00,174 --> 00:02:02,34
Shut up!

32
00:02:11,23 --> 00:02:12,317
Yeah, got it. Out.

33
00:02:12,317 --> 00:02:13,284
What's going on?!

34
00:02:13,284 --> 00:02:14,571
I heard it's Dexter.

35
00:02:14,571 --> 00:02:17,68
Wasn't he trying to protect the animals?

36
00:02:17,68 --> 00:02:19,397
Why did it come all the way to Mowtown?!

37
00:02:19,397 --> 00:02:22,859
I think it might be trying to destroy the roads to protect the animals.

38
00:02:22,859 --> 00:02:26,179
People aren't stopping the road construction despite all the warnings,

39
00:02:26,179 --> 00:02:30,15
so it's trying to destroy all the roads to protect the animals.

40
00:02:31,338 --> 00:02:33,422
Why don't we get a look at the map?

41
00:02:35,115 --> 00:02:37,507
These are the places that sinkholes appeared.

42
00:02:37,507 --> 00:02:40,350
Let's connect them and see if we can figure something out.

43
00:02:42,70 --> 00:02:44,404
Looks like there's no pattern...

44
00:02:44,404 --> 00:02:49,210
Dexter got his face injured when Wild Guardy attacked...

45
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:53,382
He probably doesn't even know where he is...

46
00:02:53,382 --> 00:02:57,56
Isn't that all... the more reason to destroy the robot?

47
00:02:57,56 --> 00:02:59,531
So we can prevent it from causing more damage?

48
00:02:59,531 --> 00:03:03,271
It's not a robot! It's a mechanical lifeform from planet Machina!

49
00:03:03,271 --> 00:03:05,458
We should try our best to talk to him!

50
00:03:05,458 --> 00:03:07,179
You think... he will listen?

51
00:03:07,179 --> 00:03:09,778
Dexter is right in wanting to protect the animals.

52
00:03:09,778 --> 00:03:11,753
He just chose the wrong way to do it.

53
00:03:11,753 --> 00:03:13,364
What if it won't listen?

54
00:03:13,364 --> 00:03:15,855
Then we'll have to fight to stop him.

55
00:03:15,855 --> 00:03:18,894
Whether you want to talk or fight, you have to find it first.

56
00:03:18,894 --> 00:03:22,65
How will you find it when it's burrowed deep underground.

57
00:03:22,65 --> 00:03:23,796
That's why I have a plan.

58
00:03:23,796 --> 00:03:25,602
Operation Underground Battle!

59
00:03:25,602 --> 00:03:28,89
Operation Underground Battle?

60
00:03:28,639 --> 00:03:31,939
For this operation to succeed...

61
00:03:31,939 --> 00:03:34,374
Crest. We need your help.

62
00:03:36,285 --> 00:03:38,481
What is that on top of the drone?

63
00:03:38,481 --> 00:03:41,280
It's an ultrasound generator to repel moles.

64
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,767
I got it because Jun said he needed it.

65
00:03:43,767 --> 00:03:46,216
We will put this baby in the sinkhole!

66
00:03:46,216 --> 00:03:50,85
Dexter is relying on the sound to get around.

67
00:03:50,85 --> 00:03:52,133
This will bring him out of the ground right away!

68
00:03:53,184 --> 00:03:56,271
The map of the sewers! I got it from my dad.

69
00:03:57,433 --> 00:04:01,413
Question: will the drone be able to communicate underground?

70
00:04:01,413 --> 00:04:04,52
Don't worry. I will control it.

71
00:04:04,52 --> 00:04:05,186
Sebastian!

72
00:04:09,655 --> 00:04:11,724
I memorized the whole thing.

73
00:04:11,724 --> 00:04:12,778
Thank you so much.

74
00:04:13,242 --> 00:04:15,10
I'll be off then!

75
00:04:17,528 --> 00:04:19,33
Let's get going, guys!

76
00:04:36,699 --> 00:04:38,587
We have a signal on the radar...

77
00:04:40,998 --> 00:04:42,750
Is it Dexter?

78
00:04:44,515 --> 00:04:45,952
It's big...

79
00:04:45,952 --> 00:04:46,858
It's coming!

80
00:04:55,187 --> 00:04:57,207
No, that's a rat...

81
00:04:59,883 --> 00:05:01,508
How is it going?

82
00:05:01,508 --> 00:05:03,169
Shall I try again?

83
00:05:05,883 --> 00:05:06,589
Is that...

84
00:05:14,490 --> 00:05:15,430
Now he's here!

85
00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:17,25
Wow...! A, uh, robot!

86
00:05:17,25 --> 00:05:18,552
It looks dangerous, let's run!

87
00:05:18,552 --> 00:05:21,347
Wait up! W-what's the matter?!

88
00:05:21,347 --> 00:05:24,284
Huh? Is that the little human?

89
00:05:24,570 --> 00:05:26,586
Yaah!

90
00:05:26,586 --> 00:05:30,835
Stop! Stop that horrible racket!

91
00:05:30,835 --> 00:05:34,188
Dexter! We don't want to hurt you either!

92
00:05:34,188 --> 00:05:36,730
We'll find a way to protect the animals!

93
00:05:36,730 --> 00:05:39,390
Please stop attacking innocent people!

94
00:05:39,390 --> 00:05:42,176
What? Humans protecting the animals?

95
00:05:42,176 --> 00:05:43,626
Don't make me laugh!

96
00:05:43,626 --> 00:05:45,539
Dexter! Listen to me!

97
00:05:45,539 --> 00:05:48,901
Metal Cardbots have to learn to coexist with humans!

98
00:05:48,901 --> 00:05:50,503
To live peacefully on this planet!

99
00:05:50,503 --> 00:05:53,219
No! Humans can't be trusted!

100
00:05:56,584 --> 00:06:00,211
Owner of the Metal Breath! You're lying to trap me in your seal!

101
00:06:01,378 --> 00:06:03,412
You leave me no choice.

102
00:06:03,412 --> 00:06:05,566
Now I have to do this! Shadow X!

103
00:06:05,566 --> 00:06:07,454
Stealth mode, off!

104
00:06:08,911 --> 00:06:09,980
Stop right there!

105
00:06:10,158 --> 00:06:11,218
How did you...

106
00:06:11,218 --> 00:06:14,77
We were prepared in case you wouldn't listen to us!

107
00:06:14,77 --> 00:06:14,996
Haha!

108
00:06:14,996 --> 00:06:18,153
He was waiting there before we began this operation!

109
00:06:20,91 --> 00:06:22,238
Will there be a fight?

110
00:06:22,238 --> 00:06:24,341
Jun... please take care of things...

111
00:06:24,341 --> 00:06:25,971
Wait... what?

112
00:06:28,579 --> 00:06:31,496
Don't be a troublemaker! Enter the seal!

113
00:06:31,496 --> 00:06:33,52
I will never!

114
00:06:35,886 --> 00:06:37,761
How can he do that...

115
00:06:38,959 --> 00:06:39,790
Huh?

116
00:06:40,855 --> 00:06:42,605
Huh. Where did he go?

117
00:06:42,605 --> 00:06:45,125
Hiding is supposed to be my thing!

118
00:06:48,27 --> 00:06:50,203
I can't use the main camera.

119
00:06:50,203 --> 00:06:54,677
But my sound wave device can detect where you are!

120
00:06:56,427 --> 00:06:57,326
There you are!

121
00:07:01,169 --> 00:07:02,750
Hey! Let go!

122
00:07:03,615 --> 00:07:05,222
Come back, Shadow X!

123
00:07:08,782 --> 00:07:10,366
Your turn, Phoenix Fire!

124
00:07:14,925 --> 00:07:16,510
You don't scare me!

125
00:07:19,10 --> 00:07:20,855
Hey! It went back inside!

126
00:07:21,336 --> 00:07:24,309
Dexter is tracking our location through sound...

127
00:07:24,309 --> 00:07:25,565
In that case...

128
00:07:25,989 --> 00:07:28,598
Phoenix Fire! Hammer Quake!

129
00:07:29,388 --> 00:07:30,210
Hammer...

130
00:07:30,210 --> 00:07:31,161
Quake!

131
00:07:32,827 --> 00:07:34,59
Augh!

132
00:07:34,59 --> 00:07:36,595
Phoenix Fire! Proceed to attack!

133
00:07:36,595 --> 00:07:39,360
Hammer Quake!

134
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:41,328
Augh! Stop it!

135
00:07:46,409 --> 00:07:47,441
Behind you!

136
00:07:47,990 --> 00:07:49,747
Water Splash!

137
00:07:50,115 --> 00:07:51,588
Augh!

138
00:07:53,343 --> 00:07:54,579
Well done!

139
00:08:00,607 --> 00:08:02,472
Your turn, Mega Ambler!

140
00:08:06,738 --> 00:08:09,540
Mega Ambler! Stop him from going back underground!

141
00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:11,308
Got it! Leave it to me!

142
00:08:18,398 --> 00:08:20,81
Forceps Crush!

143
00:08:21,802 --> 00:08:23,305
Let go of me!

144
00:08:27,901 --> 00:08:29,16
Oh no...!

145
00:08:29,16 --> 00:08:29,996
Great job, guys!

146
00:08:35,824 --> 00:08:37,551
Metal Breath, pickup!

147
00:08:39,81 --> 00:08:40,794
Blue Cop, setup!

148
00:08:47,908 --> 00:08:50,713
Dexter! It's time for a faceoff!

149
00:08:50,914 --> 00:08:52,277
You!

150
00:08:52,485 --> 00:08:53,441
Blue Cop!

151
00:09:00,346 --> 00:09:01,699
Infinity...

152
00:09:01,699 --> 00:09:03,10
Force...

153
00:09:03,10 --> 00:09:04,355
Break!!

154
00:09:20,208 --> 00:09:21,985
Metal Cardbot...

155
00:09:21,985 --> 00:09:23,164
Change Up!

156
00:09:41,976 --> 00:09:43,831
Sealing...

157
00:09:43,831 --> 00:09:45,505
Dexter!

158
00:10:01,431 --> 00:10:03,171
Now, what do you see?

159
00:10:03,686 --> 00:10:05,426
What?

160
00:10:05,426 --> 00:10:07,150
A gorilla waving?

161
00:10:07,499 --> 00:10:09,136
Looks like he's been fixed!

162
00:10:09,136 --> 00:10:10,415
What do you mean?

163
00:10:10,912 --> 00:10:12,256
Thank you guys.

164
00:10:12,256 --> 00:10:14,338
I really owe you an apology.

165
00:10:14,338 --> 00:10:16,490
Hey, what's wrong?

166
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:19,431
Is there something on your mind? Come on, you can tell us.

167
00:10:19,431 --> 00:10:21,670
Don't worry about me.

168
00:10:21,670 --> 00:10:23,691
But the animals in the forest...

169
00:10:23,691 --> 00:10:25,435
what will happen when the road is finished?

170
00:10:25,435 --> 00:10:27,903
I have something to show you. Come with me!

171
00:10:33,341 --> 00:10:34,29
Here we are.

172
00:10:38,703 --> 00:10:39,659
What?

173
00:10:40,271 --> 00:10:45,212
This road has been designed to allow wild animals to cross safely.

174
00:10:45,212 --> 00:10:50,795
Humans have come up with a way to protect the animals too.

175
00:10:50,795 --> 00:10:54,733
I see the people of this planet have shown a little consideration.

176
00:10:54,733 --> 00:10:56,561
Do you feel better now?

177
00:10:56,561 --> 00:10:58,901
Yes. I totally do.

178
00:10:58,901 --> 00:11:00,546
I'll join you as a part of your team now.

179
00:11:01,345 --> 00:11:03,993
Haha! Yeah, welcome!
