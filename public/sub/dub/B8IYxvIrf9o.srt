1
00:00:01,501 --> 00:00:05,13
Buster Gallon, the Betrayer

2
00:00:08,124 --> 00:00:11,176
That Buffalo Crush!

3
00:00:11,176 --> 00:00:14,499
He told us to leave it to him, and look what happens!

4
00:00:14,499 --> 00:00:17,827
He gets sealed and that's the end of it!

5
00:00:17,827 --> 00:00:20,770
You were just watching him get sealed. Who are you to talk?

6
00:00:20,770 --> 00:00:22,196
Shut up!

7
00:00:22,196 --> 00:00:26,298
I guess... it's really sad to lose a man from our force.

8
00:00:26,298 --> 00:00:33,683
Our plan was to rule the world with the Metal Breath in our hands.

9
00:00:33,683 --> 00:00:36,111
Buster... Gallon... what are you doing?!

10
00:00:36,111 --> 00:00:37,901
Oh, you mean this?

11
00:00:37,901 --> 00:00:44,111
This is a device to momentarily pause the function of the Metal Cardbots.

12
00:00:44,111 --> 00:00:47,139
But I think I'll just take the Metal Breath for myself.

13
00:00:47,139 --> 00:00:49,640
How dare you! You betrayed me!

14
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:51,823
That's how a pirate really works.

15
00:00:51,823 --> 00:00:53,592
Farewell... Captain.

16
00:00:56,339 --> 00:00:58,733
Buster Gallon!!

17
00:01:09,853 --> 00:01:12,730
Could you put that down here, please?

18
00:01:12,730 --> 00:01:14,373
What are you guys making?

19
00:01:14,373 --> 00:01:15,330
A shelter!

20
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:17,875
A shelter? You mean... for evacuating?

21
00:01:17,875 --> 00:01:22,450
Captain Black Hook's rule is to never lose a target he sets his eye on! 

22
00:01:22,450 --> 00:01:26,906
We have to build up our defences to keep the treasure of planet Machina safe!

23
00:01:26,906 --> 00:01:29,427
But... don't you think it's a misunderstanding?

24
00:01:29,427 --> 00:01:32,658
A Metal Cardbot can't use the Metal Breath, you know.

25
00:01:32,658 --> 00:01:33,531
Yes.

26
00:01:33,531 --> 00:01:39,150
If we could use the Metal Breath... I would have sealed the Cardbots myself.

27
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:41,917
So... you mean, even if Black Hook takes the Metal Breath...

28
00:01:41,917 --> 00:01:45,619
...he couldn't possibly make a Metal Cardbot army?

29
00:01:45,619 --> 00:01:49,971
Wouldn't explaining all of this to Black Hook make him give up?

30
00:01:49,971 --> 00:01:52,257
Listen. That's not a great idea.

31
00:01:52,257 --> 00:01:53,271
Why?

32
00:01:53,271 --> 00:01:56,945
The three of us have been trying to take the Metal Breath carefully.

33
00:01:56,945 --> 00:02:01,349
If he learns that he cannot use it, he might try to destroy it with all his might.

34
00:02:01,349 --> 00:02:02,735
That won't do!

35
00:02:02,735 --> 00:02:05,88
What do you say we attack him first?

36
00:02:05,88 --> 00:02:10,362
Yeah, that's a good idea! You might have heard the best defensive is an offensive! 

37
00:02:10,362 --> 00:02:11,998
Hey, Buffalo Crush!

38
00:02:11,998 --> 00:02:13,261
Huh? What?

39
00:02:13,261 --> 00:02:16,431
You know where Black Hook's hideout is!

40
00:02:16,431 --> 00:02:18,795
Please tell us where we can find it!

41
00:02:18,795 --> 00:02:22,16
Yeah, tell us now, Buffalo Crush!

42
00:02:22,16 --> 00:02:24,854
I can't tell you that! I gotta go!

43
00:02:27,376 --> 00:02:28,703
What are you doing?!

44
00:02:28,703 --> 00:02:30,215
Blue Cop, after him!

45
00:02:30,215 --> 00:02:30,897
Alright.

46
00:02:32,41 --> 00:02:32,885
Jun!

47
00:02:33,110 --> 00:02:34,103
Mom.

48
00:02:34,387 --> 00:02:35,424
Hello, guys.

49
00:02:35,424 --> 00:02:37,295
Uh... Hello...

50
00:02:39,546 --> 00:02:42,593
The car that just left... wasn't that our Buffy?

51
00:02:42,593 --> 00:02:45,154
Our Buffy? You mean Buffalo Crush?

52
00:02:45,154 --> 00:02:47,579
Yes. I have something for him.

53
00:02:47,579 --> 00:02:48,707
Will you pass it on?

54
00:02:48,707 --> 00:02:50,572
For him? What is it?

55
00:02:50,572 --> 00:02:53,328
It's just a gift I made for him myself.

56
00:02:59,898 --> 00:03:02,168
What are you doing here, Buffalo Crush?

57
00:03:02,168 --> 00:03:03,424
Jun...

58
00:03:03,424 --> 00:03:06,652
This is... a doll that Mom made specially for you.

59
00:03:06,652 --> 00:03:08,712
A doll she knitted herself!

60
00:03:08,712 --> 00:03:10,522
Thank you... but I can't.

61
00:03:10,522 --> 00:03:11,553
I'm sorry, what?

62
00:03:11,553 --> 00:03:14,998
Black Hook is the first friend I found before I came to Earth.

63
00:03:14,998 --> 00:03:17,37
I cannot betray him. 

64
00:03:17,37 --> 00:03:19,754
We aren't asking you to do anything.

65
00:03:19,754 --> 00:03:22,858
My Mom made this doll out of love for you!

66
00:03:22,858 --> 00:03:25,72
So I really hope you will accept it! 

67
00:03:25,72 --> 00:03:27,750
Love... for me?

68
00:03:28,410 --> 00:03:31,205
Transform into a car! I'll put it on for you!

69
00:03:35,674 --> 00:03:36,813
Does this look good?

70
00:03:36,813 --> 00:03:39,84
Yeah! It looks great on you!

71
00:03:39,84 --> 00:03:41,98
Huh? What was that?

72
00:03:41,98 --> 00:03:43,707
There's been an explosion in a warehouse in the port area.

73
00:03:43,707 --> 00:03:44,804
It's on the news right now.

74
00:03:44,804 --> 00:03:45,855
What?

75
00:03:48,69 --> 00:03:48,948
Is this it?

76
00:03:48,948 --> 00:03:52,951
-but the warehouse hasn't been used in a while. And that hasn't been anyone seen in the vicinity. The police...

77
00:03:52,951 --> 00:03:54,384
Huh?! That was our hideout!

78
00:03:54,384 --> 00:03:56,88
Really? It is close from here!

79
00:03:56,88 --> 00:03:58,900
Maybe something happened to the Captain!

80
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:01,849
Hey! Don't leave me behind!

81
00:04:02,954 --> 00:04:05,803
Blue Cop! The exploded warehouse is Black Hook's hideout!

82
00:04:05,803 --> 00:04:06,723
What?

83
00:04:06,723 --> 00:04:08,912
I am on my way. See you there!

84
00:04:09,564 --> 00:04:10,924
Let's go. All together!

85
00:04:10,924 --> 00:04:11,560
Yes!

86
00:04:26,128 --> 00:04:27,958
Stop! Stop! Stop!

87
00:04:31,693 --> 00:04:33,311
Where are you, Captain?!

88
00:04:35,655 --> 00:04:37,101
Hey, hey, look!

89
00:04:37,188 --> 00:04:40,827
It must be that... robot!

90
00:04:40,827 --> 00:04:42,85
I got it on film!

91
00:04:42,924 --> 00:04:45,595
Jun. I will be arriving soon with Shadow X.

92
00:04:45,595 --> 00:04:48,519
Yes. We have to drive out that helicopter!

93
00:04:48,519 --> 00:04:49,451
Leave it to me!

94
00:04:53,339 --> 00:04:54,263
Watch out!

95
00:04:54,263 --> 00:04:55,631
I'm sorry!

96
00:04:55,631 --> 00:04:57,595
Hey, what are you doing?!

97
00:04:58,403 --> 00:05:01,172
This is not safe. Please keep your distance.

98
00:05:05,836 --> 00:05:07,501
Jun! We did it!

99
00:05:10,362 --> 00:05:11,597
Huh?!

100
00:05:12,894 --> 00:05:14,803
Aah!

101
00:05:17,861 --> 00:05:19,878
Come back, both of you!

102
00:05:21,832 --> 00:05:22,777
Are you okay?

103
00:05:22,777 --> 00:05:24,178
My engine has been hit.

104
00:05:24,178 --> 00:05:25,902
...my propeller.

105
00:05:27,671 --> 00:05:30,416
To think that you came to me holding the Metal Breath.

106
00:05:30,416 --> 00:05:32,363
You've made things easier for me.

107
00:05:32,363 --> 00:05:35,925
What's happened here?! Buster Gallon! Where's our captain?!

108
00:05:35,925 --> 00:05:41,503
It seemed to me that it would take too long to get the Metal Breath in our hands with him in the way.

109
00:05:41,503 --> 00:05:42,866
So... I took care of things.

110
00:05:42,866 --> 00:05:44,132
What?!

111
00:05:44,132 --> 00:05:46,600
Now, Buffalo Crush! It's your turn!

112
00:05:49,545 --> 00:05:50,739
Buffalo Crush!

113
00:05:50,739 --> 00:05:52,958
I... can't... move...

114
00:05:54,414 --> 00:05:55,981
Jun! Are you alright?

115
00:05:58,80 --> 00:05:59,676
Don't come here!

116
00:05:59,676 --> 00:06:01,114
Buster Gallon!

117
00:06:01,114 --> 00:06:02,997
I have more customers.

118
00:06:06,768 --> 00:06:09,239
What happened here?!

119
00:06:10,85 --> 00:06:12,702
Just stand aside and watch!

120
00:06:12,702 --> 00:06:14,78
Mega Trucker, setup!

121
00:06:14,381 --> 00:06:16,61
Shoulder Shield!

122
00:06:17,3 --> 00:06:18,145
Twin Blaster! (FIX_THIS)

123
00:06:20,487 --> 00:06:23,626
Mega Ambler! Please! See what happened to Blue Cop!

124
00:06:25,0 --> 00:06:28,297
A powerful magnetic field is blocking the Metal Cardbot's movements.

125
00:06:30,427 --> 00:06:32,754
Found it! The magnetic field is coming from there!

126
00:06:34,511 --> 00:06:38,43
If you value your friends' lives, hand over the Metal Breath!

127
00:06:38,43 --> 00:06:38,848
It's a bomb!

128
00:06:38,848 --> 00:06:41,28
Everyone, please come back!

129
00:06:41,28 --> 00:06:42,333
Huh?! What is this...

130
00:06:42,333 --> 00:06:46,840
It's no use. All of your functions stop working when caught in the magnetic field.

131
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:48,397
How devious of him...

132
00:06:48,397 --> 00:06:50,32
We did so much research...

133
00:06:50,32 --> 00:06:54,967
Of course. Black Hook believed the Metal Breath was a treasure of Machina planet.

134
00:06:54,967 --> 00:06:55,925
But I'm different!

135
00:06:55,925 --> 00:07:00,379
That object is nothing more than a system constructed by Deus Machina, the mother computer.

136
00:07:00,379 --> 00:07:05,805
Even if it's locked so that Metal Cardbots can't use it, there is a way if you put in the time.

137
00:07:05,805 --> 00:07:08,432
Now. Hand over the Metal Breath!

138
00:07:08,432 --> 00:07:11,350
I will gather the Metal Cardbots around the universe

139
00:07:11,350 --> 00:07:14,483
to construct an empire across the galaxy!

140
00:07:14,483 --> 00:07:17,49
...y-you're out of your mind, Buster Gallon...

141
00:07:17,49 --> 00:07:18,874
I'll tell you three important things!

142
00:07:19,529 --> 00:07:21,214
Who, me?

143
00:07:21,214 --> 00:07:22,681
What do you want to tell me?

144
00:07:22,681 --> 00:07:23,470
One!

145
00:07:23,470 --> 00:07:26,742
In my experience, a talkative villain always lets down his guard and loses!

146
00:07:26,742 --> 00:07:31,122
What do you mean, let down my guard?! Your fate is in my hands!

147
00:07:31,122 --> 00:07:34,371
Two! I still have eight friends left in my team!

148
00:07:34,371 --> 00:07:37,909
Eight? Huh. There were two taken back just now...

149
00:07:37,909 --> 00:07:39,477
Huh?! One is missing!

150
00:07:41,516 --> 00:07:43,814
I found the magnetic field emitting device!

151
00:07:43,814 --> 00:07:45,130
Oh no!

152
00:07:45,130 --> 00:07:46,72
When did you...

153
00:07:47,739 --> 00:07:48,708
I'm free!

154
00:07:49,638 --> 00:07:51,338
And three!

155
00:07:51,338 --> 00:07:53,226
We are connected to Jun in spirit!

156
00:07:53,226 --> 00:07:54,600
We don't need commands!

157
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,286
We know what we need to do.

158
00:07:57,773 --> 00:07:59,444
Try to block me, then!

159
00:07:59,444 --> 00:08:00,444
You can't do that!

160
00:08:01,152 --> 00:08:02,468
Phoenix Fire, setup!

161
00:08:11,514 --> 00:08:12,679
Strike!

162
00:08:12,876 --> 00:08:15,62
Then how about this?!

163
00:08:16,134 --> 00:08:17,720
Wild Guardy, setup!

164
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:24,849
What's this?!

165
00:08:26,575 --> 00:08:27,381
Jun!

166
00:08:31,613 --> 00:08:32,862
Hey! Guys!

167
00:08:32,910 --> 00:08:35,903
This is a freeze grenade. My invention.

168
00:08:35,903 --> 00:08:39,571
A genius like me always has a backup!

169
00:08:39,571 --> 00:08:42,424
Now... what do you do with the Metal Breath?

170
00:08:42,424 --> 00:08:45,267
Hold... on...!

171
00:08:45,267 --> 00:08:49,433
Oh, dear... Buffalo Crush... you should learn when to give up.

172
00:08:49,433 --> 00:08:53,747
Inside me is the warmth of a human that knows love!

173
00:08:53,747 --> 00:08:57,750
As long as his love remains warm, my engine will never...

174
00:08:57,750 --> 00:08:59,806
...freeze up!

175
00:09:02,944 --> 00:09:04,811
Awesome! It's our turn!

176
00:09:05,602 --> 00:09:07,456
Metal Breath, pickup!

177
00:09:08,350 --> 00:09:09,754
Buffalo Crush, setup!

178
00:09:19,554 --> 00:09:21,417
Buffalo Fission! (FIX_THIS)

179
00:09:22,210 --> 00:09:25,100
Buffalo Fission!

180
00:09:26,873 --> 00:09:29,694
Let's get him! Buffalo Moonsault!

181
00:09:32,135 --> 00:09:34,920
Buffalo...

182
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:37,38
Moonsault!

183
00:09:37,38 --> 00:09:38,183
Yaah!

184
00:09:38,183 --> 00:09:40,248
Buster Blaster!

185
00:09:54,891 --> 00:09:58,140
Metal Cardbot, change up!

186
00:10:17,176 --> 00:10:19,429
Buster Gallon, seal up!

187
00:10:20,793 --> 00:10:23,66
You are a friend of ours now!

188
00:10:26,183 --> 00:10:27,681
Finally...

189
00:10:27,681 --> 00:10:30,492
I'm so sick of being unable to move!

190
00:10:30,492 --> 00:10:33,85
Looks like the freeze didn't last too long.

191
00:10:33,85 --> 00:10:34,193
That's great!

192
00:10:34,193 --> 00:10:35,672
You did it. Jun.

193
00:10:35,672 --> 00:10:38,380
It was all thanks to Buffalo Crush!

194
00:10:38,380 --> 00:10:39,873
Incredible job.

195
00:10:39,873 --> 00:10:41,340
You saved us all.

196
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:42,252
Thank you.

197
00:10:42,252 --> 00:10:45,363
We've won... but where's the Captain?

198
00:10:46,386 --> 00:10:47,187
What's that?!

199
00:10:47,187 --> 00:10:48,565
Is that an earthquake?!

200
00:10:54,523 --> 00:10:56,332
You're alive...

201
00:10:57,368 --> 00:11:00,611
Buster Gallon's puny little bomb can't do anything to me!

202
00:11:00,611 --> 00:11:02,506
Captain!

203
00:11:02,506 --> 00:11:06,242
Buffalo Crush. You're still calling me Captain?!

204
00:11:06,242 --> 00:11:07,657
Yes...

205
00:11:07,657 --> 00:11:08,804
You fool!

206
00:11:11,69 --> 00:11:12,476
That's just too much.

207
00:11:12,787 --> 00:11:14,359
And you, Earthling child!

208
00:11:14,359 --> 00:11:16,785
I will take the Metal Breath from you one day!

209
00:11:16,785 --> 00:11:18,503
You better mark my words!

210
00:11:18,503 --> 00:11:21,287
A pirate always delivers!

211
00:11:21,287 --> 00:11:24,321
You will never get it your way, you hear me?!

212
00:11:25,735 --> 00:11:27,452
The Captain hit me...
