1
00:00:01,553 --> 00:00:04,681
Goodbye, Buffalo Crush!

2
00:00:06,551 --> 00:00:10,704
What's the speed of a car that took 8 hours to travel 283 miles?

3
00:00:10,704 --> 00:00:12,645
35 miles per hour.

4
00:00:12,645 --> 00:00:13,776
Hehehe...

5
00:00:13,776 --> 00:00:17,467
How far does a plane flying at 211 miles per second fly over seven seconds?

6
00:00:17,467 --> 00:00:18,904
1,478 miles.

7
00:00:18,904 --> 00:00:20,220
Hehehe...

8
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:21,872
Homework done!

9
00:00:21,872 --> 00:00:26,247
Jun. It's no use knowing the answers if you don't know how to solve the problems.

10
00:00:26,247 --> 00:00:27,720
But you know time is gold!

11
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:31,948
I'd really like to save time on doing homework so I can read more!

12
00:00:31,948 --> 00:00:33,475
But... that's a comic book.

13
00:00:33,475 --> 00:00:35,178
A comic book is a book!

14
00:00:35,178 --> 00:00:36,485
You're right.

15
00:00:36,485 --> 00:00:39,133
Tell me. Would you like to read some of my comics?

16
00:00:39,133 --> 00:00:40,895
Aagh!

17
00:00:40,895 --> 00:00:43,656
Dad! I always tell you to knock!

18
00:00:43,656 --> 00:00:44,812
I did.

19
00:00:44,812 --> 00:00:46,757
But... who are you talking to?

20
00:00:46,757 --> 00:00:49,555
Uh, haha... I was just talking to myself.

21
00:00:49,555 --> 00:00:52,917
Talking to yourself means that you are under a lot of stress.

22
00:00:52,917 --> 00:00:55,329
You should know Milky Way will be closed tomorrow.

23
00:00:55,329 --> 00:00:56,527
Would you like to go on a trip?

24
00:00:56,527 --> 00:00:58,326
Yahoo! Awesome!

25
00:01:06,55 --> 00:01:08,866
It feels like things are not working out!

26
00:01:08,866 --> 00:01:12,989
Don't you have some brilliant plan to take the treasure of Machina planet?!

27
00:01:12,989 --> 00:01:14,798
We already know where it is...

28
00:01:14,798 --> 00:01:16,668
So why not a surprise attack?!

29
00:01:16,668 --> 00:01:18,29
Surprise attack?!

30
00:01:18,29 --> 00:01:21,567
Yes! Or we can take the child's family as hostage!

31
00:01:21,567 --> 00:01:23,269
All we want is the treasure.

32
00:01:23,269 --> 00:01:25,612
We shall not get other humans involved!

33
00:01:25,612 --> 00:01:29,562
Hahaha! I see you have some loyalty in you!

34
00:01:29,562 --> 00:01:33,518
If you have a better idea, why not say it, Buffalo Crush?

35
00:01:33,518 --> 00:01:34,834
Leave it to me!

36
00:01:35,729 --> 00:01:37,41
Where are you going now?!

37
00:01:37,41 --> 00:01:38,194
Leave him!

38
00:01:38,194 --> 00:01:41,401
A pirate always stays true to his word!

39
00:01:41,609 --> 00:01:45,387
Yes. And... I must not cause her any harm.

40
00:01:54,781 --> 00:01:57,384
Ugh... what is so fun about going on a trip?

41
00:01:57,384 --> 00:01:59,31
Shh! Be quiet!

42
00:01:59,31 --> 00:02:01,273
I could be there much faster than a car!

43
00:02:01,273 --> 00:02:02,552
Shhh!

44
00:02:02,552 --> 00:02:04,152
Talking to yourself again?

45
00:02:04,152 --> 00:02:06,576
Ahahaha! It's nothing!

46
00:02:06,576 --> 00:02:08,778
He's starting to take after you...

47
00:02:08,778 --> 00:02:09,916
Me?

48
00:02:09,916 --> 00:02:12,376
You always do that when you're driving, haven't you noticed?

49
00:02:12,376 --> 00:02:13,616
Ha, do I really?

50
00:02:14,713 --> 00:02:22,573
What's the hurry?! You gotta go to the bathroom?! Why didn't you go earlier?! You're a terrible driver! What if something had happened?! So irresponsible!

51
00:02:23,879 --> 00:02:26,550
Uh... excuse me?

52
00:02:27,379 --> 00:02:29,256
Ooh, what a strange car!

53
00:02:29,703 --> 00:02:31,741
Do you need something from them?

54
00:02:31,741 --> 00:02:33,61
Uh, yeah...

55
00:02:33,61 --> 00:02:35,429
I know they're not home today.

56
00:02:35,429 --> 00:02:38,521
They were all going on a trip to the Itar Plateau.

57
00:02:38,521 --> 00:02:40,85
Itar... Plateau?

58
00:02:40,85 --> 00:02:41,708
Thank you.

59
00:02:41,708 --> 00:02:43,679
Itar Plateau, Itar Plateau...

60
00:02:47,714 --> 00:02:51,564
Your call is not connecting. Try again later.

61
00:02:55,148 --> 00:02:56,496
Ugh! I'm bored!

62
00:02:56,496 --> 00:02:59,305
If I knew, I would've stayed at home!

63
00:02:59,743 --> 00:03:00,654
Jun.

64
00:03:00,654 --> 00:03:01,468
Yeah?

65
00:03:01,468 --> 00:03:03,758
Don't you have... something to tell me?

66
00:03:03,758 --> 00:03:05,878
Uh... something to tell you, like...

67
00:03:05,878 --> 00:03:09,203
Maybe something like any worries or secrets you have.

68
00:03:09,203 --> 00:03:11,780
I would really... like to hear from you, Jun.

69
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:13,273
Uhh... haha...

70
00:03:13,273 --> 00:03:15,866
Dad! I don't have any secrets...

71
00:03:15,866 --> 00:03:18,4
Jun. Do you think we've been discovered?

72
00:03:18,4 --> 00:03:19,546
No, I hope not...

73
00:03:22,913 --> 00:03:25,259
I'll use the restroom first. You guys go ahead.

74
00:03:25,259 --> 00:03:26,3
Okay!

75
00:03:26,391 --> 00:03:28,734
Woah! Haha!

76
00:03:29,791 --> 00:03:31,919
How's this? Pretty impressive, right?

77
00:03:31,919 --> 00:03:33,17
Yeah!

78
00:03:33,17 --> 00:03:35,440
I used to have worries at your age, too.

79
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:37,364
When I couldn't work things out,

80
00:03:37,364 --> 00:03:41,149
I would turn to nature to forget about them all.
Where is this conversation going?

81
00:03:41,149 --> 00:03:43,942
You're 12 and there are things you don't want to tell us.

82
00:03:43,942 --> 00:03:47,656
But it's not right to tell lies. That would make us sad.

83
00:03:47,656 --> 00:03:50,878
Uh... I never lied to you! C'mon, Dad!

84
00:03:50,878 --> 00:03:52,143
Wait a second.

85
00:03:53,112 --> 00:03:55,17
Hello? Theo?

86
00:03:55,17 --> 00:03:56,447
Jun! Bad news!

87
00:03:56,447 --> 00:03:58,919
Buffalo Crush was at your place!

88
00:03:58,919 --> 00:04:00,299
What?! Again?!

89
00:04:00,299 --> 00:04:02,506
I think he's headed to where you are!

90
00:04:09,116 --> 00:04:10,568
Huh? What's wrong?

91
00:04:11,955 --> 00:04:13,849
Huh? Huh!

92
00:04:15,576 --> 00:04:16,412
Hey, Jun!

93
00:04:16,412 --> 00:04:17,177
Mom!

94
00:04:17,348 --> 00:04:18,264
Jun!

95
00:04:20,470 --> 00:04:23,231
Found them! Haa!

96
00:04:23,231 --> 00:04:24,324
Huh?

97
00:04:25,285 --> 00:04:28,8
Please return the treasure of Machina planet.

98
00:04:28,8 --> 00:04:30,300
You are... what treasure?

99
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:34,154
Your son has the treasure. Please help us!

100
00:04:34,154 --> 00:04:35,719
Lady Yuri, I owe my life to you.

101
00:04:35,719 --> 00:04:38,137
I don't want you to get hurt over this!

102
00:04:38,804 --> 00:04:39,481
Mom!

103
00:04:39,481 --> 00:04:41,147
Darling, what's going on?!

104
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:44,212
Well done, Buffalo Crush!

105
00:04:44,212 --> 00:04:45,955
Black Hook!

106
00:04:45,955 --> 00:04:48,730
Now. Please take off the Metal Breath!

107
00:04:48,730 --> 00:04:50,101
Jun. Summon me now!

108
00:04:50,101 --> 00:04:51,466
No! I can't do it!

109
00:04:51,466 --> 00:04:54,278
You guys will be discovered!

110
00:04:54,278 --> 00:04:57,624
Kid. I'll give you to the count of three.

111
00:04:57,624 --> 00:05:01,47
Hand over the treasure of Machina planet!

112
00:05:01,47 --> 00:05:02,93
One.

113
00:05:02,93 --> 00:05:06,358
What do I do? I can't summon them with my parents watching. They'll find out everything!

114
00:05:06,358 --> 00:05:07,662
Two...

115
00:05:07,662 --> 00:05:08,871
I don't have a choice!

116
00:05:08,871 --> 00:05:09,256
Three!

117
00:05:09,256 --> 00:05:10,739
No!

118
00:05:12,32 --> 00:05:13,338
Buffalo Crush...

119
00:05:13,338 --> 00:05:15,820
I told you to leave this to me!

120
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:18,753
Do promises truly mean nothing to pirates?

121
00:05:18,753 --> 00:05:23,562
If only we can get the Metal Breath, such promises aren't worth it.

122
00:05:23,562 --> 00:05:24,300
Jun!

123
00:05:25,679 --> 00:05:28,878
Dad! Mom! I'm sorry! I'll explain later!

124
00:05:28,878 --> 00:05:30,466
Jun! What are you doing?!

125
00:05:32,72 --> 00:05:33,935
Metal Breath, pickup!

126
00:05:35,938 --> 00:05:37,546
Shadow X, setup!

127
00:05:38,866 --> 00:05:41,188
Haaa haa!

128
00:05:41,470 --> 00:05:43,186
Please excuse us!

129
00:05:43,186 --> 00:05:44,945
Oh my, he summoned a robot!

130
00:05:44,945 --> 00:05:45,998
Did you see that?!

131
00:05:45,998 --> 00:05:48,358
Shadow X, take him out with Heli-Tornado!

132
00:05:48,358 --> 00:05:49,353
Okay!

133
00:05:49,353 --> 00:05:51,529
Heli-Tornado!

134
00:05:51,633 --> 00:05:53,125
Quickly! Lower the sails!

135
00:05:59,151 --> 00:06:01,226
A sneak attack, I see!

136
00:06:01,226 --> 00:06:03,46
You will pay for this!

137
00:06:03,574 --> 00:06:04,987
Stop it!

138
00:06:04,987 --> 00:06:06,356
I'll repeat once again.

139
00:06:06,356 --> 00:06:08,823
You must leave it to me!

140
00:06:15,443 --> 00:06:17,745
Try and see how that works out, then.

141
00:06:17,745 --> 00:06:19,947
Hurry up and take the Metal Breath!

142
00:06:19,947 --> 00:06:21,175
Let's go, Buster Gallon.

143
00:06:21,175 --> 00:06:23,33
Huh?!

144
00:06:23,33 --> 00:06:25,556
What is this?! Hold on, Black Hook!

145
00:06:25,556 --> 00:06:28,440
Call me Captain! Captain Black Hook!

146
00:06:30,326 --> 00:06:32,416
T-Thank you, Buffalo Crush...

147
00:06:32,416 --> 00:06:33,923
The Metal Breath...

148
00:06:33,923 --> 00:06:35,785
is a treasure from Machina Planet.

149
00:06:35,785 --> 00:06:38,4
You have no right to be holding it!

150
00:06:38,4 --> 00:06:39,319
That's not true.

151
00:06:39,319 --> 00:06:40,359
Huh? Blue Cop!

152
00:06:41,928 --> 00:06:43,708
Jun is qualified to have it.

153
00:06:43,708 --> 00:06:47,287
So... I have given the Metal Breath from Deus Machina to Jun.

154
00:06:47,287 --> 00:06:49,694
Qualified? What do you mean, huh?!

155
00:06:49,694 --> 00:06:53,265
The fact that Jun has the Metal Breath... is the proof.

156
00:06:53,265 --> 00:06:57,832
I don't know what it is... but it seems other people can't hear this.

157
00:06:57,832 --> 00:06:59,793
...I don't believe this...

158
00:06:59,793 --> 00:07:01,348
Then try to fight him!

159
00:07:01,348 --> 00:07:02,406
What?

160
00:07:02,406 --> 00:07:06,291
Try to fight him! And you'll find out how strong Jun is!

161
00:07:06,291 --> 00:07:08,124
I don't like violence...

162
00:07:08,124 --> 00:07:10,958
but I'm ready to prove my friendship with the Metal Cardbots!

163
00:07:12,501 --> 00:07:13,693
Alright...

164
00:07:16,806 --> 00:07:18,171
Let's go!

165
00:07:20,997 --> 00:07:23,711
It's dangerous here. Please come with me.

166
00:07:23,711 --> 00:07:25,143
We'll stay by Jun's side.

167
00:07:25,143 --> 00:07:26,590
We won't, we're his parents!

168
00:07:26,590 --> 00:07:28,679
Now, this way please!

169
00:07:28,679 --> 00:07:31,47
Listen! I need you to be somewhere safe.

170
00:07:33,582 --> 00:07:35,183
Mega Trucker, setup!

171
00:07:40,962 --> 00:07:43,747
Mega Trucker, Mega Power Tackle!

172
00:07:45,234 --> 00:07:47,155
Finally! It's my turn!

173
00:07:57,366 --> 00:08:00,14
Amazing! This is a battle of brute force!

174
00:08:00,14 --> 00:08:01,691
Who are you calling brute?!

175
00:08:11,951 --> 00:08:14,232
Not so fast!

176
00:08:23,142 --> 00:08:24,823
Beam Omission! (FIX_THIS)

177
00:08:27,233 --> 00:08:29,405
A laser beam attack?! That's a foul play!

178
00:08:31,479 --> 00:08:33,239
What is that green thing?

179
00:08:33,239 --> 00:08:34,390
Isn't that...

180
00:08:36,582 --> 00:08:40,360
Aah! Looks like his hole isn't better yet!

181
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:42,620
Alright, thank you Mom!

182
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:45,358
Mega Trucker, Mega Touchdown!

183
00:08:48,929 --> 00:08:52,596
Mega Touchdown!

184
00:08:59,914 --> 00:09:01,293
Let's finish this!

185
00:09:01,585 --> 00:09:03,314
Dexter, setup!

186
00:09:07,195 --> 00:09:08,887
Dexter, into the ground!

187
00:09:11,924 --> 00:09:15,372
I'm so... hungry...

188
00:09:16,529 --> 00:09:19,100
Dexter, attack the Milky Way!

189
00:09:19,610 --> 00:09:21,295
Spiral Ray!

190
00:09:24,857 --> 00:09:26,805
Spiral Ray!

191
00:09:40,579 --> 00:09:43,574
Metal Cardbot, Change Up!

192
00:10:02,584 --> 00:10:05,52
Buffalo Crush... seal up!

193
00:10:07,964 --> 00:10:09,704
So I guess I've proven myself.

194
00:10:09,704 --> 00:10:11,743
Woohoo! A new subordinate!

195
00:10:11,743 --> 00:10:13,648
Hey, we don't work that way, Shadow X!

196
00:10:13,648 --> 00:10:14,49
Huh?

197
00:10:14,551 --> 00:10:16,482
Are we really just leaving?!

198
00:10:16,482 --> 00:10:18,678
He told us to leave it to him!

199
00:10:18,678 --> 00:10:21,148
A pirate does not go back on his word!

200
00:10:21,148 --> 00:10:23,531
Goodbye, Buffalo Crush!

201
00:10:23,531 --> 00:10:25,300
Are you actually crying?

202
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:26,134
Shut up!

203
00:10:28,496 --> 00:10:29,972
Mom, Dad...

204
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:32,904
I'm sorry I've been hiding it from you guys!

205
00:10:33,230 --> 00:10:34,977
You don't have to be sorry.

206
00:10:35,443 --> 00:10:39,956
Jun, we have known about the Metaca... I mean, the Metal Cardbots all along.

207
00:10:39,956 --> 00:10:41,307
That's no surprise.

208
00:10:41,754 --> 00:10:42,941
Duh???

209
00:10:42,941 --> 00:10:47,241
You've been coming home late, your most treasured bike all smashed up...

210
00:10:47,241 --> 00:10:48,742
It was all just too strange.

211
00:10:48,742 --> 00:10:53,627
So we confronted Edo. And then asked him to tell us everything he knew!

212
00:10:53,627 --> 00:10:56,533
So... he had to tell us everything that happened.

213
00:10:56,533 --> 00:11:00,312
Uh, there is a robot from Machina planet called Blue Cop! (FIX_THIS)

214
00:11:00,312 --> 00:11:02,788
We see through everything, your mom and dad.

215
00:11:02,788 --> 00:11:08,110
Not just that... we also know what you're hiding.

216
00:11:08,110 --> 00:11:09,256
Uh...

217
00:11:09,256 --> 00:11:10,762
So... you mean... you mean that...

218
00:11:10,762 --> 00:11:13,308
Don't you have something to tell me?

219
00:11:13,308 --> 00:11:16,480
Maybe something like any worries or secrets you may have?

220
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:19,151
Was this what you were talking about in the car?!

221
00:11:19,151 --> 00:11:21,150
Your scores are really bad.

222
00:11:21,150 --> 00:11:23,538
But what's worse is hiding them from us. 

223
00:11:23,538 --> 00:11:25,290
That makes me really sad.

224
00:11:25,290 --> 00:11:28,620
I-I'm really sorry, Mom and Dad!
