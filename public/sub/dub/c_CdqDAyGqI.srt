1
00:00:01,736 --> 00:00:04,759
Fire Truck With a Phobia

2
00:00:09,7 --> 00:00:10,342
Haha!

3
00:00:10,342 --> 00:00:11,566
Are you hungry yet?

4
00:00:11,566 --> 00:00:13,984
An all new Milky Way special!

5
00:00:13,984 --> 00:00:15,669
We call it... The Flame Tower!

6
00:00:15,854 --> 00:00:17,840
The Flame Tower...?

7
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:19,660
Shall we begin?

8
00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:20,569
Mhm.

9
00:00:30,388 --> 00:00:32,49
Surprise!

10
00:00:32,49 --> 00:00:34,958
Wow! This is amazing!

11
00:00:35,925 --> 00:00:39,547
You see? Everyone loves a little bit of a performance.

12
00:00:39,547 --> 00:00:42,73
You truly are the best, Dad!

13
00:00:43,411 --> 00:00:45,453
Huh? Is there a fire somewhere?

14
00:00:45,453 --> 00:00:47,156
It's getting closer and closer...

15
00:00:52,168 --> 00:00:54,592
Fire! Please evacuate!

16
00:00:58,534 --> 00:01:00,140
Fire extinguished!

17
00:01:03,27 --> 00:01:04,289
Ugh...

18
00:01:07,670 --> 00:01:09,866
Aah!!

19
00:01:09,866 --> 00:01:12,215
Urgh! This wasn't a nice surprise at all!

20
00:01:12,215 --> 00:01:14,332
Ah, no, Anna, it's not-

21
00:01:14,332 --> 00:01:15,609
Save it!

22
00:01:16,55 --> 00:01:17,967
No, Anna, wait!

23
00:01:21,565 --> 00:01:24,333
Anna, please don't go!!

24
00:01:29,878 --> 00:01:30,596
Jun.

25
00:01:33,751 --> 00:01:37,184
Jun. That fire truck was a Metal Cardbot.

26
00:01:37,184 --> 00:01:41,401
That's not important right now. I'm kinda busy here!

27
00:01:41,401 --> 00:01:42,327
Jun!

28
00:01:42,327 --> 00:01:43,731
What's going on? What's the matter?

29
00:01:48,959 --> 00:01:52,915
Seems like similar cases have been popping up everywhere these days.

30
00:01:53,177 --> 00:01:57,486
People were having a barbeque in their yard when they were sprayed with extinguisher fluid...

31
00:01:58,496 --> 00:02:01,792
The flame in a torch relay was put out...

32
00:02:03,504 --> 00:02:07,445
Candles on a birthday cake were put out by a fire truck!

33
00:02:08,476 --> 00:02:11,635
Ugh, what is going on in this city...!

34
00:02:11,635 --> 00:02:14,269
It must have been some fire truck, right?

35
00:02:14,269 --> 00:02:15,405
Probably...

36
00:02:15,405 --> 00:02:19,878
Urgh! I will find him and make him apologize to Anna properly, on his knees!

37
00:02:19,878 --> 00:02:22,733
You can find it, but you mustn't reveal the Metal Cardbots.

38
00:02:22,733 --> 00:02:24,854
I know, but... urgh!

39
00:02:24,854 --> 00:02:28,191
How do I set things straight with Anna then?

40
00:02:28,581 --> 00:02:29,994
Phoenix Fire.

41
00:02:30,345 --> 00:02:33,415
Huh? Do you know something, Mega Ambler?

42
00:02:33,415 --> 00:02:36,272
Yes. We used to work together.

43
00:02:36,812 --> 00:02:38,930
He used to be the bravest firefighter.

44
00:02:38,930 --> 00:02:41,524
No fire too big for him to handle.

45
00:02:41,524 --> 00:02:46,589
He received the Metal Medal, an honor that goes to the best rescuer on Machina planet.

46
00:02:46,589 --> 00:02:49,689
Hey, why is this rogue Cardbot playing this prank now?

47
00:02:49,689 --> 00:02:54,485
It doesn't seem to be a prank. It seems to be genuinely afraid of fire.

48
00:02:54,485 --> 00:02:58,324
Afraid of fire? A rescuer with a Metal Medal?

49
00:02:58,324 --> 00:03:02,257
I'm not sure why. I haven't met him and given him a proper counseling session.

50
00:03:02,257 --> 00:03:05,893
That coward fire truck... what do you think it's up to.

51
00:03:05,893 --> 00:03:09,201
Jun, that's a smoke bomb! Don't touch it, it's not safe!

52
00:03:09,201 --> 00:03:11,194
Oh! I see...

53
00:03:27,85 --> 00:03:28,576
Hmm...

54
00:03:30,212 --> 00:03:33,785
Confirm Metal Cardbot ID on the planet directly ahead.

55
00:03:33,843 --> 00:03:35,55
Initiating landing.

56
00:03:41,709 --> 00:03:43,477
Error in the controls!

57
00:03:45,816 --> 00:03:48,59
Oh no!

58
00:03:51,722 --> 00:03:54,204
Oh no, the controls aren't working!

59
00:03:54,204 --> 00:03:55,257
No!

60
00:04:02,763 --> 00:04:05,78
I dreamed about it again...

61
00:04:08,997 --> 00:04:11,730
Fire... is just too dangerous...

62
00:04:13,231 --> 00:04:17,76
There must be oxygen for something to catch fire.

63
00:04:17,76 --> 00:04:20,949
For example, when you place a lit candle inside a jar...

64
00:04:20,949 --> 00:04:22,741
Really? Set a trap?

65
00:04:22,741 --> 00:04:25,374
Well, since Phoenix Fire is afraid of fire,

66
00:04:25,374 --> 00:04:27,340
let's just make a fire to lure it.

67
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:29,962
Yeah, but a fire will bring real fire trucks as well.

68
00:04:29,962 --> 00:04:32,415
Right. That's a problem...

69
00:04:32,415 --> 00:04:34,700
Hey, you two! I'm over here! Focus!

70
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:36,704
We're so sorry!

71
00:04:36,704 --> 00:04:38,972
So, shall we begin the experiment?

72
00:04:44,719 --> 00:04:45,612
Huh?

73
00:04:48,576 --> 00:04:50,516
Is it a fire truck again?

74
00:04:50,516 --> 00:04:51,673
Oh no!

75
00:04:59,173 --> 00:05:00,672
Where is the fire?

76
00:05:02,372 --> 00:05:07,772
Oh my God... Woah... A real fire truck... That's amazing!

77
00:05:07,772 --> 00:05:09,947
Theo. I need you to do something.

78
00:05:09,947 --> 00:05:11,542
Huh? Do something?

79
00:05:11,542 --> 00:05:13,786
You're the only one that can help me with this!

80
00:05:13,786 --> 00:05:16,678
Uh, sure... I'll do it!

81
00:05:23,144 --> 00:05:26,228
I'm wondering if there has been a mistake. There is no fire in the school-

82
00:05:26,228 --> 00:05:29,684
Fire alarm! This is the fire alarm!

83
00:05:29,684 --> 00:05:32,334
All students, please evacuate the building!

84
00:05:32,334 --> 00:05:33,662
Huh? No!

85
00:05:34,726 --> 00:05:38,213
There has been a fire! All students, please!

86
00:05:38,213 --> 00:05:40,313
You have to evacuate the building!

87
00:05:41,426 --> 00:05:44,170
Huh? Really? Let's get out right now!

88
00:05:47,185 --> 00:05:49,524
Stay calm everyone! Please, don't run!

89
00:05:53,739 --> 00:05:56,275
Hey guys, don't panic! Stay calm!

90
00:05:58,83 --> 00:06:00,626
Jun, where are you going?

91
00:06:00,626 --> 00:06:03,358
I'll go check if there are others who haven't evacuated.

92
00:06:03,358 --> 00:06:05,380
Anna, please take care of our classmates.

93
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:07,425
Alright. Be careful!

94
00:06:08,896 --> 00:06:10,97
Huh?

95
00:06:12,299 --> 00:06:13,735
Is that the fire?

96
00:06:17,217 --> 00:06:19,154
It's a fire! Evacuate!

97
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:24,154
Hehe! I'm so sorry, but this is not a real fire!

98
00:06:24,154 --> 00:06:26,326
What? You tricked me!

99
00:06:35,788 --> 00:06:37,405
Metal Breath, pickup!

100
00:06:39,76 --> 00:06:40,728
Blue Cop, setup!

101
00:07:04,962 --> 00:07:06,987
Stop it, Phoenix Fire!

102
00:07:09,910 --> 00:07:12,38
What's wrong with putting out fires?!

103
00:07:12,38 --> 00:07:14,824
Fire is proof of civilization to the people of this planet.

104
00:07:14,824 --> 00:07:16,724
You shouldn't put out just any fire.

105
00:07:16,724 --> 00:07:18,521
That's not my problem!

106
00:07:21,541 --> 00:07:23,702
You don't know how scary fire can be!

107
00:07:23,702 --> 00:07:26,2
All fires must be put out!

108
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:48,750
Blue Cop, Burst Shot!

109
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:49,599
Got it!

110
00:07:50,986 --> 00:07:52,319
Burst Shot!

111
00:07:54,850 --> 00:07:57,284
Huh? Fire...?

112
00:07:57,619 --> 00:07:58,834
Augh!

113
00:08:05,284 --> 00:08:06,225
That's...

114
00:08:06,225 --> 00:08:08,264
That's Phoenix Fire's Metal Medal...

115
00:08:10,583 --> 00:08:15,241
Fire! Everything will go up in flames if I don't stop it...

116
00:08:19,131 --> 00:08:22,254
So, I guess this is how he got the phobia of fire.

117
00:08:22,254 --> 00:08:24,690
Looks like it's time for the doctor to step forward.

118
00:08:29,184 --> 00:08:30,660
Mega Ambler, setup!

119
00:08:34,321 --> 00:08:35,856
It's too early to take a break.

120
00:08:35,856 --> 00:08:37,409
Pull yourself up and get back to it!

121
00:08:40,972 --> 00:08:43,739
That actually worked... thanks, Mega Ambler.

122
00:08:44,765 --> 00:08:46,499
So, you're a real doctor!

123
00:08:46,604 --> 00:08:49,154
Now, Blue Cop will be able to fix Phoenix Fire.

124
00:08:52,138 --> 00:08:53,679
Wake up, Phoenix Fire.

125
00:08:54,0 --> 00:08:55,876
You're a brave rescue robot!

126
00:08:55,962 --> 00:08:57,623
What do you know?!

127
00:09:01,72 --> 00:09:02,706
Blue Cop, watch out!

128
00:09:05,470 --> 00:09:09,763
Let's end it now! Megavolt... Punch!

129
00:09:09,763 --> 00:09:12,273
Megavolt...

130
00:09:12,273 --> 00:09:13,440
Punch!!

131
00:09:23,805 --> 00:09:24,930
Now!

132
00:09:25,932 --> 00:09:29,465
Metal Cardbot, Chain Shot!

133
00:09:48,499 --> 00:09:51,39
Phoenix Fire, seal!

134
00:09:54,111 --> 00:09:56,539
Haha!

135
00:10:00,795 --> 00:10:02,424
Phew...

136
00:10:06,14 --> 00:10:09,81
I changed your temperature sensor because it was burned.

137
00:10:09,81 --> 00:10:13,261
It might take some time to get used to the new sensor, since it was made on Earth.

138
00:10:14,30 --> 00:10:15,822
Well done, Phoenix Fire!

139
00:10:16,385 --> 00:10:19,406
I'm sorry for causing trouble. Let's be a good team from now on!

140
00:10:19,406 --> 00:10:20,636
The hero has returned.

141
00:10:20,636 --> 00:10:22,691
Glad to have you back.

142
00:10:22,691 --> 00:10:23,856
Hello?

143
00:10:28,731 --> 00:10:30,187
So you were here!

144
00:10:30,187 --> 00:10:32,650
Anna...?! What brings you here?

145
00:10:32,650 --> 00:10:35,138
I thought I'd thank you for what you did.

146
00:10:35,138 --> 00:10:37,381
Here, it's a piping hot apple pie!

147
00:10:37,381 --> 00:10:40,43
Oh, you made it yourself, huh!?

148
00:10:40,43 --> 00:10:43,299
Eat it while it's hot! I think it should still be...

149
00:10:43,726 --> 00:10:46,702
Hot...pie...

150
00:10:46,702 --> 00:10:48,99
I have to put it out!

151
00:10:48,99 --> 00:10:51,193
Calm down, there's no fire...

152
00:10:51,193 --> 00:10:52,710
Ah, t-this is amazing!

153
00:10:52,710 --> 00:10:55,448
Why don't we go eat it somewhere else!

154
00:10:55,448 --> 00:10:57,902
Hey Edo, can you bring us some drinks?!

155
00:10:57,902 --> 00:10:59,779
Get them yourself!
