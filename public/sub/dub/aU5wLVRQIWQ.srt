1
00:00:01,568 --> 00:00:04,628
Blue Cop's Special Training!

2
00:00:10,292 --> 00:00:11,764
Blue Cop!

3
00:00:12,836 --> 00:00:15,219
How about you abandon this pile of scrap metal,

4
00:00:15,219 --> 00:00:18,95
and form a new team with me, Jun?

5
00:00:21,489 --> 00:00:23,367
Alright! Heeheehee!

6
00:00:23,367 --> 00:00:24,402
W-Wait!

7
00:00:36,706 --> 00:00:37,894
Jun!

8
00:00:37,894 --> 00:00:39,295
Please! Don't go without me!

9
00:00:39,295 --> 00:00:40,572
Jun!!

10
00:00:41,823 --> 00:00:42,843
What was that?

11
00:00:43,916 --> 00:00:46,276
I'm not going anywhere.

12
00:00:46,276 --> 00:00:47,989
You even had a nightmare...

13
00:00:47,989 --> 00:00:50,438
the defeat must have come as a shock.

14
00:00:50,438 --> 00:00:52,74
Come on, Blue Cop!

15
00:00:52,74 --> 00:00:55,206
You just have to show what you've got next time!

16
00:00:55,206 --> 00:00:58,887
With what I've got... you know I can't beat Wild Guardy.

17
00:00:58,887 --> 00:01:01,71
Don't doubt yourself like that!

18
00:01:01,71 --> 00:01:03,598
Just work harder to become stronger!

19
00:01:03,598 --> 00:01:05,238
Become stronger?

20
00:01:07,190 --> 00:01:09,198
So it's time for the special training?

21
00:01:09,198 --> 00:01:10,944
Special training?

22
00:01:10,944 --> 00:01:13,248
Yes. Just leave it all to me.

23
00:01:14,00 --> 00:01:15,129
Yes, sir.

24
00:01:16,935 --> 00:01:18,701
A special training for Blue Cop?

25
00:01:18,701 --> 00:01:24,363
Yeah. Uncle Edo said that he's going to find a new place and that he's going to make new equipment for the special training.

26
00:01:24,363 --> 00:01:27,31
Really? Wow! I want to see that.

27
00:01:27,31 --> 00:01:30,786
I heard it will be ready today. Should I ask?

28
00:01:30,786 --> 00:01:31,511
Blue Cop!

29
00:01:31,798 --> 00:01:32,470
Jun.

30
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:34,415
Is the special training ready?

31
00:01:34,415 --> 00:01:35,529
Yeah.

32
00:01:35,529 --> 00:01:38,549
It's almost done. We'll start the training soon.

33
00:01:39,133 --> 00:01:42,168
Alright! Keep it up! I'll be there soon.

34
00:01:42,168 --> 00:01:44,264
What are you guys so excited about?

35
00:01:44,264 --> 00:01:45,658
Waaah!!

36
00:01:45,658 --> 00:01:47,669
U-Uh, it's nothing...

37
00:01:48,496 --> 00:01:50,14
...hey guys...

38
00:01:50,342 --> 00:01:54,293
Jun, did you forget Crest invited us to his house today?

39
00:01:54,293 --> 00:01:56,326
Aha... I kinda did...

40
00:01:56,326 --> 00:01:59,262
You don't mean to say you're not coming, are you?

41
00:01:59,262 --> 00:02:01,752
Actually, I do have something, uh...

42
00:02:01,752 --> 00:02:03,814
Thought you're all busy, huh?

43
00:02:03,814 --> 00:02:06,990
If it's not urgent, why don't you just drop by?

44
00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:09,515
You said you wanted to try out the latest VR game.

45
00:02:09,515 --> 00:02:11,808
Uh... shall I...

46
00:02:11,808 --> 00:02:13,973
Hm? Of course, come on.

47
00:02:15,454 --> 00:02:18,384
Let's go.

48
00:02:31,175 --> 00:02:33,574
Woah...

49
00:02:33,574 --> 00:02:35,784
It's so huge!

50
00:02:36,708 --> 00:02:38,396
Please come in, master.

51
00:02:38,396 --> 00:02:39,901
You have a robot at home?!

52
00:02:39,901 --> 00:02:41,351
His name is Sebastian.

53
00:02:41,351 --> 00:02:43,35
Pleasure to meet you all.

54
00:02:43,35 --> 00:02:47,389
He's an all-rounder robot. Does the chores, security... you name it.

55
00:02:47,389 --> 00:02:49,35
And your parents?

56
00:02:49,35 --> 00:02:51,910
They're often overseas for work.

57
00:02:52,767 --> 00:02:56,459
So, Crest... you live here by yourself?

58
00:02:56,459 --> 00:02:59,267
Well, yeah... but I'm not actually lonely.

59
00:02:59,267 --> 00:03:02,452
I've made so many cool friends around here.

60
00:03:02,452 --> 00:03:05,553
T-that's so great, then!

61
00:03:10,678 --> 00:03:11,288
Ah!

62
00:03:12,141 --> 00:03:13,906
This is the last one.

63
00:03:14,459 --> 00:03:17,297
Alright, we're finally ready now!

64
00:03:17,297 --> 00:03:20,336
Huh? What are you going to do with these sticks?

65
00:03:20,336 --> 00:03:22,114
You'll find out soon.

66
00:03:22,114 --> 00:03:24,44
Blue Cop! To the center, please!

67
00:03:24,44 --> 00:03:25,304
Yes, sir!

68
00:03:25,653 --> 00:03:26,402
Huh?

69
00:03:27,596 --> 00:03:28,984
Shall I be here?

70
00:03:28,984 --> 00:03:29,768
Yep.

71
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:31,945
Alright, then...

72
00:03:35,411 --> 00:03:38,594
Woah...

73
00:03:50,242 --> 00:03:52,935
This training is for dodging enemy attacks and striking back.

74
00:03:52,935 --> 00:03:56,130
It applies a virtual hologram game.

75
00:03:56,130 --> 00:04:00,679
It's synced to your neural network, so it will hurt if you get hit. Got it?

76
00:04:00,679 --> 00:04:02,237
Alright, are you ready?

77
00:04:02,237 --> 00:04:03,429
Of course.

78
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:05,590
Here we go!

79
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:19,207
That looks like it hurts.

80
00:04:19,986 --> 00:04:21,657
The effects are stronger than expected.

81
00:04:21,657 --> 00:04:22,732
Are you okay?

82
00:04:23,128 --> 00:04:24,380
I'm okay.

83
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:25,580
Let's go again!

84
00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:34,191
Not a chance, mister!

85
00:04:39,12 --> 00:04:40,522
Haha! Well done, Vance! Yeah!

86
00:04:40,522 --> 00:04:42,37
Theo, you can do it!

87
00:04:45,896 --> 00:04:48,850
Haha, you'll never beat me!

88
00:04:48,850 --> 00:04:51,132
Jun, want to have a go?

89
00:04:51,132 --> 00:04:52,49
Alright!

90
00:04:52,49 --> 00:04:54,681
I will help Theo take revenge!

91
00:04:56,669 --> 00:04:59,499
Not this... not this...

92
00:04:59,499 --> 00:05:01,198
Aha! I'll choose you.

93
00:05:14,766 --> 00:05:18,559
Will this training even work for us mechanical lifeforms?

94
00:05:18,559 --> 00:05:21,515
I dunno. Looks like a waste of time.

95
00:05:21,515 --> 00:05:25,802
It is not a waste of time! Hard work and perseverance always pays off!

96
00:05:29,827 --> 00:05:30,675
Again!

97
00:05:30,836 --> 00:05:31,646
Again!

98
00:05:32,232 --> 00:05:36,131
Haha! No matter how many times you play, I'll still win!

99
00:05:36,131 --> 00:05:39,273
That was just a practice game! I'll beat you, somehow!

100
00:05:39,273 --> 00:05:42,467
Alright! I'll take you until you give up!

101
00:05:42,467 --> 00:05:45,591
Ugh. What are they getting so worked up over?

102
00:05:45,591 --> 00:05:46,887
At least they're having fun.

103
00:05:47,958 --> 00:05:49,90
Be prepared!

104
00:05:55,817 --> 00:05:56,402
Again!

105
00:06:00,437 --> 00:06:01,278
Again!

106
00:06:04,271 --> 00:06:05,71
Again!

107
00:06:08,371 --> 00:06:10,175
Grr... Again!

108
00:06:10,522 --> 00:06:12,451
Grr... Again!

109
00:06:14,604 --> 00:06:17,473
No more. You take a rest.

110
00:06:17,615 --> 00:06:20,147
I'll show you how it's done!

111
00:06:20,147 --> 00:06:21,743
Alright.

112
00:06:24,269 --> 00:06:25,623
Alright, let's go!

113
00:06:30,327 --> 00:06:32,132
It didn't hurt!

114
00:06:37,469 --> 00:06:38,328
Come on!

115
00:06:38,328 --> 00:06:39,953
Doesn't seem like an accident!

116
00:06:39,953 --> 00:06:44,401
Haha! He's running into the hits! That's got to be some kind of talent!

117
00:06:45,389 --> 00:06:48,55
Calculate the course and speed of the attack.

118
00:06:48,55 --> 00:06:50,367
And then, respond a little before it lands.

119
00:06:50,367 --> 00:06:54,439
H-hey! Wait up! Augh...

120
00:06:54,439 --> 00:06:57,271
Ugh. That didn't help at all.

121
00:06:57,271 --> 00:06:59,572
No. I think I've got it.

122
00:07:01,62 --> 00:07:03,214
Edo! Let's try one more time.

123
00:07:03,346 --> 00:07:04,854
Attack pattern?

124
00:07:04,854 --> 00:07:09,501
Mhm. Each robot character has its own attack pattern and timing.

125
00:07:09,501 --> 00:07:12,705
Figure that out and you might be able to beat Vance.

126
00:07:12,705 --> 00:07:16,301
Hmph. You couldn't beat me even if you tried it, loser!

127
00:07:16,301 --> 00:07:17,884
I see. Thanks.

128
00:07:25,525 --> 00:07:26,421
Again!

129
00:07:32,850 --> 00:07:34,193
It's working!

130
00:07:34,193 --> 00:07:35,770
I will never give up!

131
00:07:36,814 --> 00:07:40,261
Well done! Just do as I showed you!

132
00:07:40,261 --> 00:07:43,152
I think the trick is not to do as you did.

133
00:07:43,152 --> 00:07:46,680
Seems like Blue Cop's response speed has picked up!

134
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:49,756
Seems like his seeing the projectiles and moving preemptively.

135
00:07:53,807 --> 00:07:56,792
Hey! Why aren't the hits landing?!

136
00:07:57,531 --> 00:08:01,11
Grr... so that's how you're playing it!

137
00:08:03,163 --> 00:08:05,81
Maybe I should...

138
00:08:12,149 --> 00:08:13,881
Huh? Hey...

139
00:08:13,881 --> 00:08:15,943
Why are you getting bigger?!

140
00:08:15,943 --> 00:08:18,239
This is the most advanced skill!

141
00:08:42,153 --> 00:08:43,40
Never!

142
00:08:43,375 --> 00:08:44,391
Never ever!

143
00:08:44,912 --> 00:08:46,1
Give up!

144
00:08:49,793 --> 00:08:50,518
Huh?

145
00:08:51,163 --> 00:08:52,33
What...

146
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:53,820
Is this...

147
00:08:56,874 --> 00:08:58,13
Jun!
Blue Cop!

148
00:09:07,513 --> 00:09:08,888
Infinite...

149
00:09:08,888 --> 00:09:10,490
Force...

150
00:09:10,490 --> 00:09:11,767
Blade!!

151
00:09:27,314 --> 00:09:28,930
Aw, come on!

152
00:09:30,211 --> 00:09:33,548
What was that about?! It was just dumb luck!

153
00:09:35,850 --> 00:09:37,870
Hey Jun. Could you give me that bracelet?

154
00:09:37,870 --> 00:09:38,735
Augh?!

155
00:09:38,735 --> 00:09:41,183
Of course I'm not asking just to take it.

156
00:09:41,183 --> 00:09:43,539
I'll give you anything you want in this room. 

157
00:09:43,539 --> 00:09:44,723
Shall we do a trade?

158
00:09:44,723 --> 00:09:45,988
For real?

159
00:09:45,988 --> 00:09:47,857
I'd be taking this TV!

160
00:09:47,857 --> 00:09:49,877
How about this robot?

161
00:09:49,877 --> 00:09:52,766
W-what are you talking about?

162
00:09:52,766 --> 00:09:54,771
Maybe it's something important to Jun.

163
00:09:54,771 --> 00:09:57,112
It's up to Jun to decide if he wants to trade. 

164
00:09:57,112 --> 00:09:59,482
So... what would you like to have?

165
00:09:59,482 --> 00:10:01,697
Uhh...

166
00:10:01,697 --> 00:10:03,726
Sorry! I have to go now!

167
00:10:04,387 --> 00:10:06,410
T-Thanks for the game!

168
00:10:08,574 --> 00:10:11,270
So... he just ran away...

169
00:10:14,457 --> 00:10:16,85
Blue Cop!

170
00:10:16,937 --> 00:10:17,577
Jun!

171
00:10:21,945 --> 00:10:25,666
I got it now! When our hearts join as one, we become stronger!

172
00:10:25,666 --> 00:10:28,601
So it's true. The voice from before... it was you.

173
00:10:28,601 --> 00:10:32,376
It seems like the Metal Breath still holds many secrets that we have to discover.

174
00:10:32,376 --> 00:10:33,323
Hm.

175
00:10:33,323 --> 00:10:37,550
So when you share your feelings, the power of the card grows...

176
00:10:37,550 --> 00:10:39,485
and new skills are unleashed.

177
00:10:39,485 --> 00:10:42,976
Then... we could also power up like Blue Cop!

178
00:10:42,976 --> 00:10:45,596
Alright! Let's start training together!

179
00:10:45,596 --> 00:10:49,150
It could be Wild Guardy or Heavy Iron... we could beat them all!

180
00:10:49,150 --> 00:10:50,640
Let's do it, guys!

181
00:10:50,869 --> 00:10:53,158
But... where's Uncle Edo?

182
00:10:55,825 --> 00:10:58,939
My storage room...!

183
00:11:03,729 --> 00:11:06,814
I really thought I had him where I wanted.

184
00:11:06,814 --> 00:11:09,867
But I didn't manage to get the Metal Breath.

185
00:11:09,867 --> 00:11:11,758
I'm sorry, Wild Guardy.

186
00:11:11,758 --> 00:11:13,842
