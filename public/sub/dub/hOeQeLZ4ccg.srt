1
00:00:01,641 --> 00:00:04,480
The Hungry Metal Cardbot

2
00:00:15,957 --> 00:00:18,31
Hm? Has there been an accident?

3
00:00:19,858 --> 00:00:20,985
Hello?

4
00:00:21,688 --> 00:00:22,935
Are you alright?

5
00:00:24,770 --> 00:00:26,660
H-Hello?

6
00:00:28,186 --> 00:00:30,141
I... I'm hungry!

7
00:00:30,996 --> 00:00:32,390
Aah!

8
00:00:53,301 --> 00:00:57,612
We have a report that a monster truck transformed into a robot

9
00:00:57,612 --> 00:01:01,324
and ate a battery from an electric car that was passing by on Route 66 last night.

10
00:01:01,324 --> 00:01:05,187
I-I mean, a garish looking car suddenly started saying it was hungry, and it transformed into...

11
00:01:05,187 --> 00:01:06,851
Mmph? Could this be?

12
00:01:06,851 --> 00:01:09,207
Yes. I'm sure it's a Metal Cardbot.

13
00:01:09,207 --> 00:01:09,951
Jun!

14
00:01:11,96 --> 00:01:13,225
You're gonna be late for school again!

15
00:01:13,225 --> 00:01:13,981
Uh, yes!

16
00:01:14,966 --> 00:01:16,121
I'll be off, then!

17
00:01:16,121 --> 00:01:17,976
Do you know where it happened, Jun?

18
00:01:17,976 --> 00:01:19,666
Yes! A country road outside Mowtown-

19
00:01:19,666 --> 00:01:20,715
What are you saying?

20
00:01:22,64 --> 00:01:24,385
Hahaha, what's got you all jumpy, huh?

21
00:01:24,385 --> 00:01:27,14
Uh... Dad, what are you doing below the car?

22
00:01:27,14 --> 00:01:28,945
Well, the car is acting a little strange.

23
00:01:28,945 --> 00:01:31,512
I think it's broken somewhere. But I just can't figure out...

24
00:01:31,512 --> 00:01:33,758
...well, I'll be going off to school then!

25
00:01:36,598 --> 00:01:39,152
I had a great stay thanks to all of you.

26
00:01:39,152 --> 00:01:40,442
Thank you so much!

27
00:01:40,897 --> 00:01:43,100
Crest!!

28
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:45,409
I'll never forget the fun times we had!

29
00:01:45,409 --> 00:01:47,309
We're friends for life-

30
00:01:47,309 --> 00:01:48,755
Oh no, Crest!

31
00:01:48,755 --> 00:01:51,200
I can't believe you're leaving us, Crest!

32
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,479
Oh, you mustn't forget me no matter what!

33
00:01:53,479 --> 00:01:55,464
Haha, thank you...

34
00:01:55,464 --> 00:01:58,42
He's a big star from start to end.

35
00:01:58,42 --> 00:01:59,275
You said it!

36
00:01:59,275 --> 00:02:02,209
Hope things will be fine until the farewell party tonight.

37
00:02:02,209 --> 00:02:04,679
The news this morning didn't sound good...

38
00:02:04,679 --> 00:02:09,950
Everybody's looking for the culprit now, so we'll find out soon enough- huh?

39
00:02:09,950 --> 00:02:11,486
Did you find anything?

40
00:02:11,486 --> 00:02:14,677
I found traces of oil spilled by a Metal Cardbot.

41
00:02:14,677 --> 00:02:16,179
It might be from the culprit.

42
00:02:16,179 --> 00:02:17,877
Do you mean the culprit was hurt?

43
00:02:17,877 --> 00:02:19,413
I'm not sure.

44
00:02:19,413 --> 00:02:21,173
But it looks like he went downtown.

45
00:02:22,17 --> 00:02:23,902
Okay, I leave you to it then.

46
00:02:23,902 --> 00:02:25,575
You can count on me.

47
00:02:28,701 --> 00:02:31,684
What timing for the car to break on the day of the party...

48
00:02:31,684 --> 00:02:35,223
I asked  for a replacement vehicle, so it should be alright.

49
00:02:35,223 --> 00:02:36,996
Well, I'll be off then!

50
00:02:36,996 --> 00:02:38,210
Take care, honey!

51
00:02:38,703 --> 00:02:41,305
Ugh... time to prepare for the party...

52
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:53,932
Ugh... how odd... I just ate... but I'm hungry again...

53
00:02:53,932 --> 00:02:56,655
I wonder... why that is...

54
00:03:08,623 --> 00:03:10,179
Ah! Oh...

55
00:03:13,363 --> 00:03:14,496
Wha? What's that?!

56
00:03:15,304 --> 00:03:17,175
Uh... uh...

57
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:20,301
When did that arrive now?

58
00:03:23,703 --> 00:03:26,221
Hello? Oh, Edo!

59
00:03:26,221 --> 00:03:29,384
About the car. It seems like the tank is rusty.

60
00:03:29,384 --> 00:03:32,359
It seems it's going to take about a week to fix.

61
00:03:32,359 --> 00:03:36,419
What? I'm going to be driving around in that garish looking truck for a week?!

62
00:03:36,419 --> 00:03:40,879
What garish looking truck? I haven't sent the replacement vehicle yet.

63
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:43,428
But there's... one right here- Huh?

64
00:03:45,256 --> 00:03:46,167
What?

65
00:03:48,457 --> 00:03:52,966
Uh, Edo... I'm sorry. Forget about what I just said. I must have made a mistake.

66
00:03:52,966 --> 00:03:58,31
So... you said the repair would take a week? I'll wait for the replacement vehicle then.

67
00:03:58,31 --> 00:03:58,31
Please send a normal car.

68
00:03:58,31 --> 00:04:01,807
Please send a normal car...
I... I can't hold it any longer! Aagh!

69
00:04:01,807 --> 00:04:05,918
Oh, in an hour? Don't worry, I'll be here. Alright...

70
00:04:08,325 --> 00:04:10,76
I'm really hungry!!

71
00:04:10,909 --> 00:04:14,194
Hello? Hello? Are you there, Yuri?

72
00:04:14,194 --> 00:04:17,273
A garish looking car suddenly started saying it was hungry!

73
00:04:17,273 --> 00:04:20,138
Then it transformed into a robot and attacked my car! I was so scared!

74
00:04:20,138 --> 00:04:21,653
Huh... wait a minute!

75
00:04:25,897 --> 00:04:29,372
I found the trail of oil! It goes to the residential area!

76
00:04:29,372 --> 00:04:31,394
That is where Jun's house is...

77
00:04:31,394 --> 00:04:32,397
Let's hurry!

78
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:34,115
H-Hey! Hang on!

79
00:04:34,115 --> 00:04:35,374
Wait for us!

80
00:04:40,745 --> 00:04:43,564
I'm so... hungry...

81
00:04:43,564 --> 00:04:46,916
I... wanna eat... that...

82
00:04:47,569 --> 00:04:50,594
You want to eat... this generator?

83
00:04:50,594 --> 00:04:51,806
Gimme!

84
00:04:52,270 --> 00:04:54,178
Then you need to ask nicely!

85
00:04:55,501 --> 00:04:56,409
I said no!

86
00:04:57,165 --> 00:04:59,17
And your hands are all dirty!

87
00:04:59,17 --> 00:04:59,748
Hang on.

88
00:05:02,88 --> 00:05:03,170
There you go.

89
00:05:04,347 --> 00:05:07,609
Now. You have to say "thank you" before eating.

90
00:05:07,609 --> 00:05:09,11
Say, "thanks for the food".

91
00:05:09,11 --> 00:05:11,568
Sorry. Thanks for the food, lady.

92
00:05:12,93 --> 00:05:13,191
Hmph.

93
00:05:16,518 --> 00:05:17,690
So good...

94
00:05:17,690 --> 00:05:19,640
Oh yeah. Good job.

95
00:05:20,454 --> 00:05:22,349
See you in the evening, Anna.

96
00:05:22,349 --> 00:05:24,270
Yeah, see you later!

97
00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:25,668
Take care!

98
00:05:26,756 --> 00:05:27,736
Jun.

99
00:05:27,736 --> 00:05:29,1
Blue Cop! Did you find him?

100
00:05:29,1 --> 00:05:31,453
We found that the trail of oil is heading to your neighborhood.

101
00:05:31,453 --> 00:05:32,510
What?!

102
00:05:32,714 --> 00:05:36,530
Jun! Jun!

103
00:05:36,530 --> 00:05:38,757
Get in. Something has happened at your house!

104
00:05:38,757 --> 00:05:40,631
Wha?! No way!

105
00:05:42,899 --> 00:05:44,409
Uh... what's wrong...?

106
00:05:44,409 --> 00:05:45,602
I'm still hungry.

107
00:05:45,602 --> 00:05:46,683
Oh.

108
00:05:46,683 --> 00:05:49,369
Is there a problem with the voltage?

109
00:05:49,369 --> 00:05:50,141
Hm...

110
00:05:51,909 --> 00:05:54,294
Hang on. Excuse me.

111
00:05:56,846 --> 00:06:00,165
Oh dear. There's a hole in there from a nail.

112
00:06:00,165 --> 00:06:01,998
This must be the problem.

113
00:06:03,487 --> 00:06:05,47
Stick your bottom out.

114
00:06:05,265 --> 00:06:06,678
Like this?

115
00:06:06,678 --> 00:06:08,446
That's right.

116
00:06:08,936 --> 00:06:11,527
Oh, you poor thing...

117
00:06:12,787 --> 00:06:14,114
Hang in there.

118
00:06:35,717 --> 00:06:37,258
There you go!

119
00:06:42,259 --> 00:06:44,608
T-Thank you, lady!

120
00:06:44,608 --> 00:06:46,162
Don't mention it.

121
00:06:46,162 --> 00:06:48,233
But, who are you, anyway?

122
00:06:48,233 --> 00:06:50,582
I am... Buffalo Crush.

123
00:06:50,582 --> 00:06:53,1
I'm Yuri. Finish your meal.

124
00:06:53,1 --> 00:06:53,943
Thanks.

125
00:06:59,434 --> 00:07:01,775
He's in our yard?!

126
00:07:03,305 --> 00:07:05,836
Hey, hot pink! What are you doing in my house?!

127
00:07:05,836 --> 00:07:06,919
Mom?!

128
00:07:08,915 --> 00:07:11,99
Let my mom go right now!

129
00:07:13,365 --> 00:07:14,278
Huh?

130
00:07:14,278 --> 00:07:17,277
That's the treasure from Deus Machina. The Metal Breath!

131
00:07:18,596 --> 00:07:21,858
Hey! Give me that!

132
00:07:22,132 --> 00:07:24,968
So this is why you're taking my mom hostage, huh?!

133
00:07:24,968 --> 00:07:27,258
Hostage? What do you mean?

134
00:07:30,472 --> 00:07:31,895
Stop it.

135
00:07:32,290 --> 00:07:35,24
Say "I'm done, thank you" if you're done eating.

136
00:07:35,24 --> 00:07:37,374
Huh?! I'm done, thank you lady.

137
00:07:37,890 --> 00:07:38,928
Jun.

138
00:07:38,928 --> 00:07:41,438
Wild Guardy and I will soon be at your place.

139
00:07:41,438 --> 00:07:43,877
I'm in my house right now. Please hurry.

140
00:07:43,877 --> 00:07:45,232
What? Okay.

141
00:07:46,178 --> 00:07:48,690
Uh... I have something to discuss with you about the repairs.

142
00:07:48,690 --> 00:07:51,572
What? But I have to prepare for the party...

143
00:07:57,579 --> 00:07:58,688
That's Edo's car!

144
00:08:01,589 --> 00:08:03,118
Jun! Are you alright?

145
00:08:03,118 --> 00:08:04,661
Blue Cop! Wild Guardy!

146
00:08:04,661 --> 00:08:08,187
Buffalo Crush? Why are you here?

147
00:08:10,426 --> 00:08:11,584
Give me the Metal Breath!

148
00:08:11,584 --> 00:08:12,606
What?!

149
00:08:12,946 --> 00:08:13,920
Blue Cop, setup!

150
00:08:18,943 --> 00:08:19,946
Wild Guardy!

151
00:08:32,967 --> 00:08:34,784
He's way too strong!

152
00:08:34,784 --> 00:08:38,207
Buffalo Crush has been fed!

153
00:08:38,207 --> 00:08:41,62
That means I'm... unbeatable!

154
00:08:42,17 --> 00:08:43,869
Mega Trucker! Where are you?!

155
00:08:43,869 --> 00:08:44,914
Ugh.

156
00:08:44,914 --> 00:08:47,36
Come on, move already!

157
00:08:50,922 --> 00:08:53,929
We must not let him overpower us with brute force!

158
00:08:53,929 --> 00:08:55,987
Let's confuse him with serial attacks!

159
00:08:55,987 --> 00:08:57,170
Got it!

160
00:09:00,105 --> 00:09:01,520
Wild Guardy, setup!

161
00:09:05,515 --> 00:09:07,201
Bring it on!

162
00:09:07,498 --> 00:09:09,136
That shield is nothing.

163
00:09:09,218 --> 00:09:10,779
Tomahawk Crush!

164
00:09:12,402 --> 00:09:13,311
Gotcha! Sorry, pal.

165
00:09:16,576 --> 00:09:19,24
The time is now. Megavolt Punch!

166
00:09:20,355 --> 00:09:21,361
Megavolt...

167
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:25,481
Buffalo...

168
00:09:25,481 --> 00:09:27,88
Moonsault!

169
00:09:35,743 --> 00:09:38,354
He's as hard to break as my shield...

170
00:09:38,354 --> 00:09:40,976
Blue Cop! Let's finish with Infinity Force Break!

171
00:09:40,976 --> 00:09:41,906
Got it!

172
00:09:42,362 --> 00:09:44,27
Infinity...

173
00:09:46,371 --> 00:09:47,0
Force...

174
00:09:49,534 --> 00:09:51,6
Who's that?!

175
00:09:51,268 --> 00:09:55,239
Where are you roaming about, Buffalo Crush?

176
00:09:55,239 --> 00:09:56,520
That sounded like...

177
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:57,830
Buster Gallon.

178
00:09:57,830 --> 00:09:58,838
W-Who's that?!

179
00:09:58,838 --> 00:10:00,362
Black Hook's crewmate.

180
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:06,120
I am here for the Metal Breath like I promised, Earthling child.

181
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:08,325
I never invited you to my house!

182
00:10:08,325 --> 00:10:10,366
And you're never getting the Metal Breath!

183
00:10:10,366 --> 00:10:15,274
If you want to turn this place into a battlefield, I have nothing to lose!

184
00:10:20,567 --> 00:10:22,685
Let's just go back.

185
00:10:22,685 --> 00:10:24,290
I'm sorry, what are you saying?

186
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:27,558
Black Hook. You said this before.

187
00:10:27,558 --> 00:10:31,142
A real Cardbot always repays a favor.

188
00:10:31,142 --> 00:10:33,1
Our restaurant sticker?

189
00:10:34,921 --> 00:10:39,439
I guess... if you have a good reason...

190
00:10:39,439 --> 00:10:42,880
Fools. It was the chance of a lifetime.

191
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:45,41
We're heading west. Let's go!

192
00:10:48,182 --> 00:10:50,714
I don't understand what's going on here...

193
00:10:52,354 --> 00:10:55,799
I followed the trail of oil and found an escape pod in the forest.

194
00:10:55,799 --> 00:10:58,489
Perhaps... it was damaged during the escape?

195
00:10:58,489 --> 00:11:01,252
So... Jun's mom fixed the leak!

196
00:11:01,252 --> 00:11:05,212
She must have been shocked!

197
00:11:05,212 --> 00:11:08,992
So it's all thanks to your mom that we're having this great party.

198
00:11:08,992 --> 00:11:10,219
But Crest...

199
00:11:10,219 --> 00:11:13,327
Now that there are all these new enemies, I'm a little bit worried.

200
00:11:13,327 --> 00:11:15,657
I truly believe you will defeat them all.

201
00:11:15,657 --> 00:11:16,790
I think so too!

202
00:11:16,790 --> 00:11:19,890
We'll be fine as long as we work together!

203
00:11:19,890 --> 00:11:21,776
Promise you will be back, Crest!

204
00:11:21,776 --> 00:11:23,715
Mhm. Of course!
