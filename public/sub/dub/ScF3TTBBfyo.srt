1
00:00:01,611 --> 00:00:05,165
The Great Showdown! Giant VS Giant!

2
00:00:07,334 --> 00:00:09,613
Right turn at the next intersection, please.

3
00:00:09,613 --> 00:00:10,854
Okay...

4
00:00:10,854 --> 00:00:13,822
Crest! Don't you think you can tell us now?

5
00:00:13,822 --> 00:00:16,122
Yeah! Where are we going?

6
00:00:16,122 --> 00:00:19,665
I told you this is a mystery tour to a surprise location.

7
00:00:19,665 --> 00:00:21,811
So we'll find out when we get there.

8
00:00:21,811 --> 00:00:26,103
Oh well... Crest is all about the secrets, I see.

9
00:00:26,103 --> 00:00:29,247
He's just serious, intelligent, and can keep his mouth shut.

10
00:00:29,247 --> 00:00:32,125
Yeah, yeah! The opposite of someone we know!

11
00:00:32,125 --> 00:00:33,915
Really? Who's that, now?

12
00:00:33,915 --> 00:00:35,623
Don't let that get to you, Jun.

13
00:00:35,623 --> 00:00:37,780
And what do you mean by that, Blue Cop?!

14
00:00:47,398 --> 00:00:48,413
Here we are.

15
00:00:48,522 --> 00:00:50,855
Our destination was Mowtown's landfill...

16
00:00:50,855 --> 00:00:52,633
I've never been here before...

17
00:00:52,633 --> 00:00:55,292
Now... tell us why you've brought us here.

18
00:00:55,292 --> 00:00:57,277
Sure. It's this.

19
00:00:58,573 --> 00:00:59,999
Here in the map?

20
00:00:59,999 --> 00:01:00,920
Yeah.

21
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:02,367
What's the blinking thing?

22
00:01:02,367 --> 00:01:06,932
The signal from a GPS transmitter attached to Heavy Iron.

23
00:01:06,932 --> 00:01:08,35
Heavy Iron?!

24
00:01:11,366 --> 00:01:15,137
Do you know what you're doing?! Heavy Iron isn't to be messed with!

25
00:01:15,137 --> 00:01:17,87
Mhm. I heard from Wild Guardy.

26
00:01:17,87 --> 00:01:19,403
You knew, and you still brought us here?!

27
00:01:19,403 --> 00:01:22,174
So you mean... Heavy Iron is here right now?!

28
00:01:22,174 --> 00:01:24,66
Yeah. Over there.

29
00:01:25,392 --> 00:01:27,115
Waah!

30
00:01:27,115 --> 00:01:29,60
That's too close!

31
00:01:29,60 --> 00:01:30,540
What if we get caught!

32
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:34,421
Don't worry! He hasn't moved an inch since I started tracking him.

33
00:01:34,421 --> 00:01:38,932
Oh... so he can't move due to the injuries from the last battle...

34
00:01:38,932 --> 00:01:42,862
So... you mean Heavy Iron is deep asleep because he's recovering?

35
00:01:42,862 --> 00:01:47,30
Yes. Us Metal Cardbots have a self recovering function powered by nanomachines.

36
00:01:47,30 --> 00:01:50,392
But... it's not enough to just stay still like that.

37
00:01:50,392 --> 00:01:53,514
It takes a lot of energy to heal a single wound.

38
00:01:53,514 --> 00:01:54,721
Energy?

39
00:01:54,721 --> 00:01:58,926
Metal Cardbots are like humans too. We get hungry even if we've been lying still.

40
00:01:58,926 --> 00:02:00,687
I wonder... what do you guys eat?

41
00:02:00,687 --> 00:02:05,177
We eat all kinds of fuel! Gasoline, electricity, methane...

42
00:02:05,177 --> 00:02:08,632
A landfill like this is full of methane gas.

43
00:02:08,632 --> 00:02:10,248
Really? You eat methane?

44
00:02:10,248 --> 00:02:11,577
Sure.

45
00:02:11,577 --> 00:02:14,398
It's a simple pleasure, but it tastes so good.

46
00:02:14,398 --> 00:02:18,500
He can't do much while in recovery, so now is the best chance to seal him.

47
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:22,251
Okay, Blue Cop. We gotta seal him before he makes a move.

48
00:02:23,991 --> 00:02:25,502
Metal Breath, pickup!

49
00:02:31,18 --> 00:02:32,417
What's... that?!

50
00:02:39,111 --> 00:02:41,168
Isn't that a ship with sails?!

51
00:02:41,168 --> 00:02:42,143
Is that...

52
00:02:42,143 --> 00:02:43,549
Black Hook!

53
00:02:43,549 --> 00:02:44,672
You know him?

54
00:02:44,672 --> 00:02:45,500
Yes.

55
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:48,496
He was a famous pirate in Machina planet.

56
00:02:48,496 --> 00:02:52,496
Many Star Guardians have gone after him, but were beaten instead.

57
00:02:54,672 --> 00:02:58,708
Aah! Stop it! You'll wake Heavy Iron!

58
00:02:59,829 --> 00:03:02,242
Hahaha!

59
00:03:02,242 --> 00:03:11,203
You've been hiding in this trash heap! You fit right in, Heavy Iron!

60
00:03:11,203 --> 00:03:12,203
Ah...

61
00:03:12,567 --> 00:03:16,856
Where is the Star Crown? My stolen treasure!

62
00:03:27,963 --> 00:03:29,66
Hmph.

63
00:03:29,66 --> 00:03:31,859
It's been a while, Black Hook.

64
00:03:31,859 --> 00:03:34,945
The Star Crown is safe with me.

65
00:03:34,945 --> 00:03:36,390
Glad to hear!

66
00:03:36,390 --> 00:03:39,414
Nothing a pirate likes more than to loot and plunder!

67
00:03:39,414 --> 00:03:42,2
You're just to come at me! (FIX_THIS)

68
00:03:48,871 --> 00:03:51,747
One was bad enough, but now there are two of them?!

69
00:03:51,747 --> 00:03:53,786
Jun, what do we do?

70
00:03:53,786 --> 00:03:56,259
Don't worry. It might be a good thing.

71
00:03:56,259 --> 00:03:57,460
Jun's right, guys.

72
00:03:57,460 --> 00:04:00,757
We watch them fight it out and seal the one who loses. I wonder who will it be...

73
00:04:00,757 --> 00:04:02,463
Like fishing in troubled waters.

74
00:04:20,672 --> 00:04:21,955
Everyone, run!

75
00:04:29,852 --> 00:04:30,739
Jun!

76
00:04:34,105 --> 00:04:35,795
And who are you?!

77
00:04:35,921 --> 00:04:39,668
Hey. You're the kid that was controlling Blue Cop.

78
00:04:39,668 --> 00:04:41,32
That kid?!

79
00:04:42,790 --> 00:04:46,389
You mean that Earthling child is a master of a Star Guardian?!

80
00:04:46,389 --> 00:04:48,203
Don't be ridiculous.

81
00:04:48,951 --> 00:04:50,864
I-Is that...

82
00:04:50,864 --> 00:04:54,533
The Metal Breath?! Legendary treasure of Deus Machina?!

83
00:04:54,533 --> 00:04:56,219
Give it to me!!

84
00:04:57,117 --> 00:04:59,620
Not a chance! Don't even think about it!

85
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:01,190
Blue Cop, setup!

86
00:05:02,737 --> 00:05:03,713
Yaah!

87
00:05:07,808 --> 00:05:09,241
Jun. Are you alright?

88
00:05:09,241 --> 00:05:10,502
I'm okay...

89
00:05:10,502 --> 00:05:13,262
Here you are, Blue Cop.

90
00:05:13,262 --> 00:05:16,14
So you are the surviving Star Guardian...

91
00:05:16,14 --> 00:05:19,163
Yes. Even if my home planet no longer exists,

92
00:05:19,163 --> 00:05:22,575
the will of Deus Machina is engraved in my memory circuit.

93
00:05:22,575 --> 00:05:24,279
What a joke!

94
00:05:24,279 --> 00:05:27,844
Black Hook. Let's settle our score some other day.

95
00:05:27,844 --> 00:05:30,711
You want a truce, huh?

96
00:05:30,711 --> 00:05:32,281
Guys, let's get out of here!

97
00:05:32,281 --> 00:05:33,791
Come on, let's go!

98
00:05:34,644 --> 00:05:37,583
I'll take up the offer, however...

99
00:05:37,583 --> 00:05:41,253
The treasure is all mine! Raah!

100
00:05:47,369 --> 00:05:49,831
He can't fight them both...

101
00:05:49,831 --> 00:05:51,454
Jun! I'm okay!

102
00:05:51,454 --> 00:05:53,931
Blue Cop, we'll confuse them! Run!

103
00:05:53,931 --> 00:05:54,940
Got it!

104
00:05:57,466 --> 00:05:59,804
You won't get away so easily.

105
00:06:07,896 --> 00:06:09,607
I'm okay. You gotta go now!

106
00:06:09,607 --> 00:06:10,846
Be careful, Jun!

107
00:06:13,298 --> 00:06:15,855
I'll admit you have guts, kiddo!

108
00:06:15,855 --> 00:06:18,37
Now, hand over the Metal Breath!

109
00:06:18,37 --> 00:06:19,937
What if I don't do it?!

110
00:06:20,677 --> 00:06:22,290
Shadow X, setup!

111
00:06:22,865 --> 00:06:25,458
Yeah! Haha!

112
00:06:25,611 --> 00:06:28,468
Shadow X, Spinning Cutter from the sky!

113
00:06:29,503 --> 00:06:30,968
Spinning Cutter!

114
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:36,75
It hurts!

115
00:06:36,75 --> 00:06:36,773
Huh?

116
00:06:38,742 --> 00:06:40,187
Heli-Tornado!

117
00:06:40,382 --> 00:06:42,510
Heli-Tornado!

118
00:06:47,987 --> 00:06:49,667
Where is the kiddo?!

119
00:06:50,413 --> 00:06:52,559
Hey Captain, I'm not over there!

120
00:06:56,864 --> 00:06:59,296
You annoying little fruit fly!

121
00:06:59,508 --> 00:07:01,544
Please, hang in there Shadow X!

122
00:07:01,544 --> 00:07:03,453
Don't worry, I got it!

123
00:07:03,453 --> 00:07:05,793
Blue Cop, we are on our way too!

124
00:07:05,793 --> 00:07:08,560
We have to seal Heavy Iron as soon as possible!

125
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:09,905
Got it!

126
00:07:09,905 --> 00:07:12,446
Enough with the games!

127
00:07:23,837 --> 00:07:24,854
Blue Cop!

128
00:07:25,797 --> 00:07:28,233
Not looking so smart, are you kiddo?

129
00:07:28,233 --> 00:07:30,73
Wild Guardy, we need to hurry!

130
00:07:30,73 --> 00:07:31,198
Got it!

131
00:07:35,726 --> 00:07:38,490
I'll end you once and for all!

132
00:07:43,998 --> 00:07:45,452
Metal Breath, pickup!

133
00:07:47,212 --> 00:07:48,800
Wild Guardy, setup!

134
00:07:58,856 --> 00:08:00,389
I'll take you on!

135
00:08:06,4 --> 00:08:08,915
You'll pay for this wound a hundred times over!

136
00:08:08,915 --> 00:08:10,514
Not interested!

137
00:08:14,134 --> 00:08:16,955
Start playing fair and show yourself!

138
00:08:17,906 --> 00:08:20,320
I'd hadn't won perfect? What a joke! (FIX_THIS)

139
00:08:23,683 --> 00:08:25,354
There you are!

140
00:08:28,36 --> 00:08:30,523
Where have you gone, Earthling child?!

141
00:08:33,135 --> 00:08:35,263
Where is that pirate going next?

142
00:08:35,263 --> 00:08:37,139
Listen, Edo! We need to follow them!

143
00:08:37,139 --> 00:08:39,907
Uh-oh, alright! Guys, hang on tight!

144
00:08:52,354 --> 00:08:54,419
Nice one! Wild Slash!

145
00:08:54,470 --> 00:08:55,526
Wild...

146
00:08:55,526 --> 00:08:56,509
Slash!

147
00:09:04,591 --> 00:09:07,678
I would like to stay and play, but this ends now.

148
00:09:07,678 --> 00:09:10,231
I still need to get some rest.

149
00:09:10,231 --> 00:09:11,611
Both of you, run!

150
00:09:14,832 --> 00:09:16,239
He's not gonna try that...

151
00:09:19,854 --> 00:09:21,938
Hey, Heavy Iron!

152
00:09:23,628 --> 00:09:26,310
If you fire that, the Metal Breath will also end up in smithereens!

153
00:09:26,310 --> 00:09:28,222
That's not my problem.

154
00:09:28,222 --> 00:09:29,739
What?

155
00:09:29,739 --> 00:09:31,405
That was not our deal!

156
00:09:31,405 --> 00:09:34,32
I never made a deal with you!

157
00:09:35,22 --> 00:09:37,388
Captain's Cannon!

158
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:41,605
Iron Cannon!

159
00:09:47,953 --> 00:09:49,317
Over there!

160
00:09:51,586 --> 00:09:52,949
Could they be...

161
00:09:52,949 --> 00:09:53,821
Jun...

162
00:09:57,308 --> 00:09:58,231
Wild Guardy!

163
00:09:58,358 --> 00:09:59,616
Jun is okay.

164
00:09:59,616 --> 00:10:03,197
I thought I was done for this time...

165
00:10:03,197 --> 00:10:05,364
That brought back some bad memories...

166
00:10:05,364 --> 00:10:06,545
What a relief.

167
00:10:06,545 --> 00:10:08,480
Do you think either one of them is down?

168
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:09,793
I don't think so...

169
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:12,872
Ugh... No way...

170
00:10:12,872 --> 00:10:16,804
I only came for my Star Crown, and what a mess!

171
00:10:16,804 --> 00:10:19,877
Earthling child! That will be all for today.

172
00:10:19,877 --> 00:10:22,332
I'll be back for your Metal Breath soon,

173
00:10:22,332 --> 00:10:24,965
so hang on to it until I return!

174
00:10:24,965 --> 00:10:26,558
Hahaha!

175
00:10:26,558 --> 00:10:28,69
Jun, what about Heavy Iron?

176
00:10:28,69 --> 00:10:30,596
I don't think that was enough to get him.

177
00:10:30,596 --> 00:10:34,662
There's no use staying here any longer. Let's get out of here, guys!

178
00:10:44,418 --> 00:10:45,812
Aah!

179
00:10:45,812 --> 00:10:47,763
Hey, take it easy, man!

180
00:10:47,763 --> 00:10:49,149
Ugh. Stop moving.

181
00:10:49,149 --> 00:10:50,911
Wild Guardy is fine.

182
00:10:50,911 --> 00:10:53,378
Just a little tear in the fuel hose. I replaced it.

183
00:10:53,378 --> 00:10:54,850
That's good to hear.

184
00:10:54,850 --> 00:10:56,851
Those two were really scary...

185
00:10:56,851 --> 00:11:01,877
Heavy Iron and Black Hook. Two of the most powerful Cardbots showed up at once!

186
00:11:01,877 --> 00:11:05,179
We have to become stronger ourselves to be able to seal those two.

187
00:11:05,179 --> 00:11:06,937
Yes, Jun!

188
00:11:07,549 --> 00:11:10,63
I'll leave it to you guys from now on.

189
00:11:10,63 --> 00:11:12,615
What do you mean, Crest?

190
00:11:12,615 --> 00:11:15,410
The thing is, I realize how foolish I've been.

191
00:11:15,410 --> 00:11:18,36
In the future, I'll try to help you in different ways.

192
00:11:18,36 --> 00:11:19,280
Crest!

193
00:11:19,490 --> 00:11:22,793
Please take care of Wild Guardy, Jun.

194
00:11:24,738 --> 00:11:26,387
Of course!
