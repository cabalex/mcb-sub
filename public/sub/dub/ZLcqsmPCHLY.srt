1
00:00:01,568 --> 00:00:04,852
Mystery of the Police Car Robot!

2
00:00:47,732 --> 00:00:49,564
I was so close...

3
00:00:50,310 --> 00:00:51,692
Hm?

4
00:00:51,692 --> 00:00:54,615
Ah! I'm going to be late for school!

5
00:01:00,283 --> 00:01:01,651
Hm?

6
00:01:01,850 --> 00:01:03,454
Huh, what's that?

7
00:01:27,733 --> 00:01:30,406
A... robot?

8
00:01:30,664 --> 00:01:32,417
This ends now, Mega Trucker!

9
00:01:32,847 --> 00:01:34,700
You'll have to come with me.

10
00:01:38,783 --> 00:01:40,225
That's what you'd like, Blue Cop.

11
00:01:40,854 --> 00:01:41,823
Wouldn't you?!

12
00:01:45,474 --> 00:01:47,831
Look here, it's not over yet!

13
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:50,641
You stubborn old truck!

14
00:01:55,79 --> 00:01:57,188
My BMX!

15
00:02:11,163 --> 00:02:12,859
A human boy...?

16
00:02:16,206 --> 00:02:19,78
Ugh! This isn't over!

17
00:02:21,9 --> 00:02:22,477
Stop right there!

18
00:02:27,275 --> 00:02:30,890
What have you done to my bike!!

19
00:02:30,890 --> 00:02:33,567
And where did my helmet go?

20
00:02:42,144 --> 00:02:46,296
Hey, we'll be in middle school next year

21
00:02:46,296 --> 00:02:47,119
and you're still saying,

22
00:02:47,119 --> 00:02:49,840
"I saw a robot! I saw an alien!"

23
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:51,961
How old are you?

24
00:02:51,961 --> 00:02:54,52
Oh my God, Vance, you're so funny!

25
00:02:54,52 --> 00:02:56,834
I swear I saw it with my own eyes!

26
00:02:56,834 --> 00:02:58,670
A police car transformed into a robot!

27
00:02:58,670 --> 00:03:01,20
Oh really? Where's the evidence, huh?

28
00:03:01,20 --> 00:03:02,336
Uhhh...

29
00:03:02,336 --> 00:03:04,20
Look at my crushed BMX!

30
00:03:04,20 --> 00:03:07,370
Uh... sorry, but it just looks like you fell and broke your own bike.

31
00:03:07,370 --> 00:03:11,736
Ha! You made up a story about a robot for that?! Vance, you're sharp!

32
00:03:11,736 --> 00:03:15,811
You should have made up a more believable story, Jun.

33
00:03:15,811 --> 00:03:17,480
I don't think he's lying.

34
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:18,439
Huh?

35
00:03:18,439 --> 00:03:20,949
But Anna, what do you mean by that?

36
00:03:20,949 --> 00:03:23,343
You couldn't be thinking that Vance is wrong?!

37
00:03:23,343 --> 00:03:26,752
I just know Jun wouldn't make up a silly story like that.

38
00:03:26,752 --> 00:03:30,247
That's right, Anna! You know you can always trust me!

39
00:03:30,247 --> 00:03:32,807
I think he's probably just mistaken.

40
00:03:36,913 --> 00:03:39,298
Ugh... she didn't believe me either...

41
00:03:39,298 --> 00:03:41,921
I believe you saw the robot, Jun.

42
00:03:42,951 --> 00:03:44,699
Theo!

43
00:03:46,223 --> 00:03:47,852
Security cameras?

44
00:03:47,852 --> 00:03:50,949
If what you said did happen, something must have been caught on video!

45
00:03:50,949 --> 00:03:52,289
Oh, right!

46
00:03:53,605 --> 00:03:54,463
Huh?

47
00:03:55,504 --> 00:03:57,961
Yeah, so when I got here this morning, I saw-

48
00:03:57,961 --> 00:04:01,24
Huh? Jun!

49
00:04:01,24 --> 00:04:03,343
Jun, you're safe and sound!

50
00:04:03,343 --> 00:04:06,169
Stop it! I can't breathe!

51
00:04:06,169 --> 00:04:10,104
I mean I was worried, you know? When I got here, everything was a mess!

52
00:04:10,104 --> 00:04:14,936
I saw your bike and thought something happened to you too!

53
00:04:14,936 --> 00:04:17,713
Hehe... I'm sorry, Edo...

54
00:04:17,713 --> 00:04:20,24
Alright, I'm good now.

55
00:04:20,24 --> 00:04:22,310
Seems like it's all good. We'll be off, then.

56
00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:23,656
Thanks for coming!

57
00:04:23,656 --> 00:04:24,406
Thanks.

58
00:04:27,918 --> 00:04:30,504
Tell me, what brings you guys here?

59
00:04:30,504 --> 00:04:32,415
We need the security footage!

60
00:04:32,747 --> 00:04:34,125
Huh?

61
00:04:37,259 --> 00:04:38,507
Look over here!

62
00:04:38,507 --> 00:04:40,156
Rewind a little bit, please!

63
00:04:45,503 --> 00:04:47,66
It's all covered up...

64
00:04:47,66 --> 00:04:48,732
Yeah, didn't even get the license plate...

65
00:04:48,732 --> 00:04:51,473
If we only had the license plate for the police car-

66
00:04:51,473 --> 00:04:55,32
What would you do with that? Would you go to the police station and ask,

67
00:04:55,32 --> 00:04:57,338
"Is there a car here that transforms into a robot?"

68
00:04:57,338 --> 00:04:59,362
I knew it! You don't believe me either!

69
00:04:59,362 --> 00:05:01,294
Who would believe that story...?

70
00:05:01,294 --> 00:05:04,173
If only there was some other clue...

71
00:05:04,173 --> 00:05:06,112
Hang on! I have this!

72
00:05:08,420 --> 00:05:10,894
I picked it up when all of that happened.

73
00:05:10,894 --> 00:05:12,603
Did the robots leave that behind?

74
00:05:12,603 --> 00:05:14,454
I think it could be.

75
00:05:14,454 --> 00:05:17,449
I think it could be something you could buy in any shop.

76
00:05:25,949 --> 00:05:27,533
Stop fooling around, Edo...

77
00:05:27,533 --> 00:05:32,817
Agh, no! I really can't lift it! It really won't come off at all!

78
00:05:32,817 --> 00:05:34,487
I'll give it a go, then.

79
00:05:36,244 --> 00:05:38,668
I can't move it at all, not an inch!

80
00:05:38,668 --> 00:05:41,230
Nah, you're just kidding! See?

81
00:05:41,534 --> 00:05:43,682
Agh! What's going on?!

82
00:05:43,682 --> 00:05:45,735
That's what I should be asking...

83
00:05:47,754 --> 00:05:50,317
Let's look for a place where a dump truck might be parked...

84
00:05:50,317 --> 00:05:52,691
You guys never give up, do you?

85
00:05:52,691 --> 00:05:55,928
You're trying to impress Anna, aren't you?

86
00:05:55,928 --> 00:05:58,82
Nah, not at all, Theo!

87
00:05:58,82 --> 00:05:59,225
I'll be back soon!

88
00:05:59,225 --> 00:06:01,553
Please tell me you'll throw away that strange watch, will you?

89
00:06:01,553 --> 00:06:02,711
Yeah, I will!

90
00:06:18,545 --> 00:06:22,79
Ugh... guess it wouldn't be easy to find, right?

91
00:06:22,79 --> 00:06:25,371
It might not even be in this town anymore...

92
00:06:25,371 --> 00:06:26,485
Stop it!

93
00:06:26,485 --> 00:06:27,596
Anna?!

94
00:06:28,181 --> 00:06:30,612
Tell us, what's the matter, Anna?

95
00:06:30,612 --> 00:06:32,574
Do you think you are better than us?!

96
00:06:32,574 --> 00:06:36,627
That's not it! You're vandalizing our city without permission!

97
00:06:36,627 --> 00:06:39,305
You just think you're always right!

98
00:06:39,305 --> 00:06:44,37
Why do you care so much about this city? You want to get sprayed too?!

99
00:06:44,37 --> 00:06:45,106
Stop it!

100
00:06:45,373 --> 00:06:46,297
Stop it!

101
00:06:47,63 --> 00:06:48,24
J-Jun?

102
00:06:48,292 --> 00:06:50,432
So you want to play being a hero?

103
00:06:50,432 --> 00:06:51,860
What about the robot?

104
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:53,303
I'll find it soon!

105
00:06:53,303 --> 00:06:55,177
You sound quite confident!

106
00:06:58,161 --> 00:07:02,226
Agh! I stepped on poop...

107
00:07:02,226 --> 00:07:04,279
Want a taste?!

108
00:07:04,279 --> 00:07:07,788
Get away, get away!

109
00:07:07,788 --> 00:07:10,887
How dare you! Aah!

110
00:07:10,887 --> 00:07:13,956
You fell for it! See you later, Anna!

111
00:07:13,956 --> 00:07:14,438
Jun!

112
00:07:32,420 --> 00:07:33,769
Ta-da!

113
00:07:38,588 --> 00:07:40,435
Not too bad!

114
00:07:40,435 --> 00:07:43,137
You cannot run anymore!

115
00:07:43,137 --> 00:07:45,858
Let's not resort to any kind of violence, you guys!

116
00:07:46,156 --> 00:07:47,540
Shut up!

117
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:50,334
Hey! You give that back!

118
00:07:50,334 --> 00:07:54,64
This is for tricking me, you fool!

119
00:07:54,64 --> 00:07:54,697
Hey!

120
00:07:54,697 --> 00:07:56,55
Stop struggling!

121
00:08:02,175 --> 00:08:03,963
I said, stop it!

122
00:08:30,846 --> 00:08:32,865
What have you done now?

123
00:08:42,374 --> 00:08:44,778
That's the robot I saw...

124
00:08:55,262 --> 00:08:56,390
Wha...

125
00:08:56,390 --> 00:08:58,289
A robot! Jun was telling the truth!

126
00:08:58,289 --> 00:08:59,759
Come on, that's impossible!

127
00:08:59,759 --> 00:09:01,643
I'm sure it was just a trick!

128
00:09:01,643 --> 00:09:03,291
But I don't think so, Vance...

129
00:09:03,291 --> 00:09:06,62
Listen up! You better not tell anyone about this,

130
00:09:06,62 --> 00:09:09,711
unless you want to be called a liar just like Jun!

131
00:09:09,711 --> 00:09:11,727
Alright...

132
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:17,666
Aah! What's going on?!

133
00:09:24,51 --> 00:09:26,100
How is this happening?!

134
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:26,833
Let me introduce myself.

135
00:09:26,833 --> 00:09:27,649
Huh?

136
00:09:27,649 --> 00:09:29,900
I am Blue Cop, from planet Machina.

137
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:31,39
Blue Cop?

138
00:09:33,173 --> 00:09:37,531
Agh! Does this mean I am actually inside a robot?! Seriously?!

139
00:09:39,772 --> 00:09:41,807
Help, I've been eaten by a robot!!

140
00:09:41,807 --> 00:09:43,817
Huh? Calm down!

141
00:09:44,347 --> 00:09:46,270
Get me out before I am digested!

142
00:09:46,270 --> 00:09:47,28
Digested?

143
00:09:47,28 --> 00:09:50,283
Hang on, please don't push me down! Send me back up!

144
00:09:50,283 --> 00:09:53,519
I am a mechanical lifeform. I don't digest anything.

145
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:54,615
Oh, really?

146
00:09:55,8 --> 00:09:56,980
It's going to get a little bumpy.

147
00:09:56,980 --> 00:09:58,644
Aah!

148
00:10:02,20 --> 00:10:05,870
My home, Machina planet, was completely annihilated by a giant explosion.

149
00:10:05,870 --> 00:10:06,818
Annihilated?

150
00:10:06,818 --> 00:10:12,934
Since I came to this planet, I have been disguising myself as a car to avoid alarming the natives.

151
00:10:12,934 --> 00:10:15,692
As you say, a tree is best hidden in a forest.

152
00:10:15,692 --> 00:10:17,213
That actually makes sense...

153
00:10:17,917 --> 00:10:20,876
I have to live on planet Earth now.

154
00:10:20,876 --> 00:10:24,639
So I am trying to learn as much about this planet as quickly as I can.

155
00:10:29,293 --> 00:10:31,268
I like this planet very much.

156
00:10:31,268 --> 00:10:34,931
However, there are some of my kind who have not adjusted to life here.

157
00:10:34,931 --> 00:10:36,899
You mean, like that dump truck from yesterday?

158
00:10:36,899 --> 00:10:38,779
It's not the only one.

159
00:10:38,779 --> 00:10:43,628
There are more Metal Cardbots hiding on planet Earth right now.

160
00:10:43,628 --> 00:10:46,138
I only wish to help them, so that they do not cause any harm to the natives of this planet.

161
00:10:46,138 --> 00:10:48,364
If I don't succeed-

162
00:10:48,364 --> 00:10:52,534
Hang on a second! Why are you telling me all this now?!

163
00:10:52,534 --> 00:10:55,779
Because, it looks like the Metal Breath chose you, sir.

164
00:10:55,779 --> 00:10:57,832
What? Metal Breath?

165
00:10:57,832 --> 00:11:01,783
The Metal Breath can only be possessed by the chosen one.

166
00:11:01,783 --> 00:11:05,509
The one who holds the Metal Breath will become the king, the ruler, of all Metal Cardbots.

167
00:11:05,509 --> 00:11:07,52
K-king?

168
00:11:07,52 --> 00:11:11,136
Uh! Pardon my mistake. I mean... the boss? The master?

169
00:11:11,136 --> 00:11:13,168
So, you mean... someone important?

170
00:11:13,168 --> 00:11:14,782
Yes sir! That's correct.

171
00:11:14,782 --> 00:11:18,264
No way! I've never been hall monitor or anything!

172
00:11:18,264 --> 00:11:22,211
Excuse me. Would you please lend me your powers, sir?

173
00:11:22,211 --> 00:11:25,460
Hmm... alright!

174
00:11:25,460 --> 00:11:26,800
On one condition, though!

175
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:28,235
Yes, sir?

176
00:11:28,235 --> 00:11:31,576
My name is Jun Grant! Call me Jun, not sir!

177
00:11:31,576 --> 00:11:32,961
Yes, Jun!

178
00:11:32,961 --> 00:11:35,355
And one more thing!

179
00:11:35,355 --> 00:11:40,267
My BMX that your friend crashed! I'll need to be compensated for that!
