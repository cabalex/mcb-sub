1
00:00:01,505 --> 00:00:04,791
Heavy Battle

2
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:08,796
Attention, citizens!

3
00:00:08,796 --> 00:00:11,626
Landfill #30 is off limits!

4
00:00:11,626 --> 00:00:14,749
Uhh... can we even have a look?! C'mon! Aww!

5
00:00:20,351 --> 00:00:23,0
It looks like a giant piece of candy...

6
00:00:23,0 --> 00:00:26,44
It could be a magma rock...?

7
00:00:26,734 --> 00:00:28,780
I know what that is. That's Machinasium.

8
00:00:28,780 --> 00:00:29,579
What?

9
00:00:29,807 --> 00:00:31,292
What?! Machinasium?!

10
00:00:31,292 --> 00:00:32,299
What is that?

11
00:00:32,299 --> 00:00:34,453
It's a metal found only on Machina planet.

12
00:00:34,453 --> 00:00:39,337
The core metal that is the heart of Metal Cardbots is also made of Machinasium.

13
00:00:39,337 --> 00:00:41,476
What is now doing on Earth?

14
00:00:41,476 --> 00:00:43,723
Shadow X! Please do a patrol!

15
00:00:43,723 --> 00:00:44,881
Leave it to me!

16
00:00:49,266 --> 00:00:52,368
A shining stone has filled the entire island!

17
00:00:52,368 --> 00:00:55,154
There's a hole on top! I'll take a look!

18
00:00:55,154 --> 00:00:56,700
Okay! Thank you!

19
00:01:02,715 --> 00:01:03,913
Shadow X!

20
00:01:06,68 --> 00:01:07,537
Jun! Let's hurry!

21
00:01:08,251 --> 00:01:11,611
What was that just now?! There was something like a laser?!

22
00:01:11,611 --> 00:01:13,835
We are... assessing the situation, so please calm down!

23
00:01:14,822 --> 00:01:16,391
Emergency support vehicle passing through!

24
00:01:16,391 --> 00:01:17,523
Please! Allow us!

25
00:01:17,523 --> 00:01:18,938
Support? But we haven't heard anything-

26
00:01:18,938 --> 00:01:21,717
There appears to be a crashed helicopter in that landfill!

27
00:01:21,717 --> 00:01:24,37
We don't have time! Please, let us through!

28
00:01:25,719 --> 00:01:31,671
[crowd murmurs]

29
00:01:42,10 --> 00:01:43,510
Are you okay, Shadow X?!

30
00:01:44,921 --> 00:01:46,119
Hey! What happened here!

31
00:01:46,119 --> 00:01:47,921
I didn't see that coming at all...

32
00:01:47,921 --> 00:01:49,721
What a surprise, right...?

33
00:01:50,68 --> 00:01:51,233
Who did this to you?!

34
00:01:51,233 --> 00:01:52,498
It was Heavy Iron...

35
00:01:52,498 --> 00:01:53,395
What?!

36
00:01:55,202 --> 00:01:57,614
Hahaha!

37
00:01:57,614 --> 00:01:59,2
Do you find this funny, Black Hook?!

38
00:01:59,2 --> 00:02:00,179
Just as I expected!

39
00:02:00,179 --> 00:02:04,688
Heavy Iron is planning to use the Star Crown to reconstruct this planet!

40
00:02:04,688 --> 00:02:06,355
What do you mean, "reconstruct"?

41
00:02:06,355 --> 00:02:08,318
And what is the Star Crown?

42
00:02:08,318 --> 00:02:09,716
Let me explain.

43
00:02:09,716 --> 00:02:13,839
The Star Crown is one of the hidden treasures of Machina planet.

44
00:02:13,839 --> 00:02:18,86
Using that, you can transform your planet into a copy of Machina planet.

45
00:02:18,86 --> 00:02:21,401
I stole it and brought it here... but Heavy Iron took it from me!

46
00:02:21,401 --> 00:02:26,587
So the huge mass of Machinasium that just appeared on Earth... was created by the Star Crown?

47
00:02:26,587 --> 00:02:29,537
Yes. You can call it the Seed of Machinasium.

48
00:02:29,537 --> 00:02:34,67
If you don't do anything, it will absorb all the heat on this planet to multiply itself.

49
00:02:34,67 --> 00:02:35,379
And what will happen then?

50
00:02:35,379 --> 00:02:37,937
I believe you can work that out yourself.

51
00:02:37,937 --> 00:02:42,655
If all heat on planet Earth disappears... it might mean that its metal will disappear!

52
00:02:42,655 --> 00:02:47,768
Its magnetic field disappears, allowing radiation from space to burn down on the Earth's surface!

53
00:02:47,768 --> 00:02:49,438
Anna and Theo, you've worked it out!

54
00:02:49,438 --> 00:02:51,180
So... you mean to say that...

55
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:55,596
That means all life on Earth... just as we know it... could go extinct?!

56
00:02:55,828 --> 00:02:59,34
Oh no! Jun! You have to seal him up right away!

57
00:02:59,34 --> 00:03:00,91
Shadow X!

58
00:03:00,91 --> 00:03:02,186
You can't let Heavy Iron have it his way!

59
00:03:02,186 --> 00:03:04,301
I like it here on Earth!

60
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:06,991
I have taken emergency measures.

61
00:03:06,991 --> 00:03:09,862
Thank you. Shadow X!

62
00:03:09,862 --> 00:03:10,938
Please come back!

63
00:03:11,969 --> 00:03:14,445
Guys. I will go inside that dome!

64
00:03:14,445 --> 00:03:16,354
Huh?! No way, it's dangerous!

65
00:03:16,354 --> 00:03:18,509
You don't even know what it's like inside the dome!

66
00:03:18,509 --> 00:03:22,11
I still have to go! It's my duty as the owner of the Metal Breath!

67
00:03:22,11 --> 00:03:25,436
Hey, calm down, Jun! You don't have to carry everything on your shoulders!

68
00:03:25,436 --> 00:03:27,658
You can leave these things to the grownups, you know?

69
00:03:27,658 --> 00:03:28,345
I won't!

70
00:03:28,345 --> 00:03:29,237
Calm down, Jun!

71
00:03:29,237 --> 00:03:32,969
Heavy Iron is also a Metal Cardbot that escaped from Machina planet!

72
00:03:32,969 --> 00:03:35,574
He's no different from our friends!

73
00:03:35,574 --> 00:03:38,333
And you know I will not leave anyone behind!

74
00:03:38,333 --> 00:03:39,989
But... I'm worried about you!

75
00:03:42,270 --> 00:03:44,265
...fine. Have it your way.

76
00:03:44,265 --> 00:03:45,690
Thank you, Mister Edo!

77
00:03:45,690 --> 00:03:47,32
Why'd you stop calling me Uncle?!

78
00:03:47,32 --> 00:03:50,58
Thank you, Edo. We promise to protect the planet.

79
00:03:51,415 --> 00:03:52,889
I'll be waiting for you!

80
00:03:52,889 --> 00:03:54,427
Take care of yourself, Jun!

81
00:03:54,578 --> 00:03:56,280
Okay! I'll be off then!

82
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:58,43
But what is your plan now?

83
00:03:58,43 --> 00:04:01,38
You would get struck down if you fly over there!

84
00:04:01,389 --> 00:04:03,844
Well... there's one thing we can try!

85
00:04:05,62 --> 00:04:06,507
Oh! Look there!

86
00:04:07,124 --> 00:04:09,979
Oh! Seems like an ambulance is finally getting here!

87
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:14,709
Oh, wow! It looks like the ambulance that entered the landfill!

88
00:04:14,709 --> 00:04:16,491
Huh? Anna and Theo?

89
00:04:16,491 --> 00:04:18,273
And the owner of the car repair shop?

90
00:04:18,273 --> 00:04:19,656
Over here!

91
00:04:19,656 --> 00:04:22,68
What were you all doing over there?!

92
00:04:22,68 --> 00:04:23,324
Huh?

93
00:04:24,279 --> 00:04:26,658
Jun... please come back safe...

94
00:04:38,326 --> 00:04:39,122
Here!

95
00:04:39,122 --> 00:04:39,518
Yes!

96
00:04:47,570 --> 00:04:49,469
Is this the inside of the dome?

97
00:04:49,469 --> 00:04:51,784
It feels like we're back on Machina planet...

98
00:04:52,367 --> 00:04:54,290
Welcome, kiddo.

99
00:04:54,290 --> 00:04:57,968
How's the brat who recieved my welcome back there?

100
00:04:57,968 --> 00:04:58,904
Heavy Iron!

101
00:05:01,601 --> 00:05:02,798
The Star Crown!

102
00:05:02,798 --> 00:05:04,769
Oh... you mean, this?

103
00:05:05,261 --> 00:05:07,657
You can take it if you want it.

104
00:05:07,657 --> 00:05:09,840
Dexter! Spiral Ray!

105
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:11,284
Spiral...

106
00:05:11,284 --> 00:05:12,508
Too slow.

107
00:05:15,921 --> 00:05:17,167
Dexter!

108
00:05:19,401 --> 00:05:22,36
Be careful! It's the super beam that hit me!

109
00:05:22,36 --> 00:05:23,916
But he barely lifted a finger!

110
00:05:23,916 --> 00:05:28,41
Of course. He needed the power of using the Star Crown!

111
00:05:28,41 --> 00:05:31,25
I'll wait while you choose your next fighter.

112
00:05:31,25 --> 00:05:33,299
We have more than enough time.

113
00:05:36,790 --> 00:05:38,791
Okay, guys! Let's attack all at once!

114
00:05:38,791 --> 00:05:39,675
Alright!

115
00:05:45,528 --> 00:05:46,406
Heh.

116
00:05:52,696 --> 00:05:54,524
Buster Gallon, setup!

117
00:05:57,287 --> 00:05:58,486
Twin Vulcan!

118
00:06:02,667 --> 00:06:04,872
Fleta Z! Setup!

119
00:06:14,836 --> 00:06:15,906
Beak Arrow!

120
00:06:18,130 --> 00:06:19,860
Our attacks aren't working!

121
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:21,891
Then we have to try something strong!

122
00:06:21,891 --> 00:06:23,41
Fleta Z!

123
00:06:23,41 --> 00:06:24,591
Vulture Wings!

124
00:06:29,11 --> 00:06:29,831
Hahaha.

125
00:06:29,831 --> 00:06:30,664
Not even a scratch-

126
00:06:30,664 --> 00:06:32,71
Augh!

127
00:06:34,356 --> 00:06:35,309
It's a throne!

128
00:06:35,309 --> 00:06:36,284
Mega Ambler?!

129
00:06:36,284 --> 00:06:40,315
The throne that the Star Crown has made is releasing Machinasium energy.

130
00:06:40,315 --> 00:06:42,71
It's making long range attacks useless.

131
00:06:42,403 --> 00:06:44,262
Then we have to go up close!

132
00:06:44,262 --> 00:06:45,893
Jun! I think it's my turn!

133
00:06:46,91 --> 00:06:47,287
Phoenix Fire!

134
00:06:47,799 --> 00:06:48,660
What about me?!

135
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:50,190
Sorry. Hang in there!

136
00:06:50,862 --> 00:06:52,280
Water Splash!

137
00:06:53,431 --> 00:06:55,60
Buffalo Crush! Setup!

138
00:06:57,318 --> 00:06:59,189
Buffalo Moonsault!

139
00:07:00,711 --> 00:07:01,934
Buffalo...

140
00:07:01,934 --> 00:07:03,573
Moonsault!

141
00:07:19,290 --> 00:07:20,301
Buffalo Crush!

142
00:07:20,301 --> 00:07:21,566
It's your turn, Blue Cop!

143
00:07:25,401 --> 00:07:26,921
Megavolt...

144
00:07:26,921 --> 00:07:28,473
Punch!

145
00:07:30,568 --> 00:07:32,492
It's no use!

146
00:07:32,492 --> 00:07:34,93
Do it now, Phoenix Fire!

147
00:07:36,495 --> 00:07:38,472
I told you, it's no use!

148
00:07:38,472 --> 00:07:39,572
I don't care!

149
00:07:39,572 --> 00:07:41,330
Go for it, Phoenix Fire!

150
00:07:41,330 --> 00:07:42,526
Burning...

151
00:07:42,526 --> 00:07:44,159
Hammer!

152
00:07:48,766 --> 00:07:49,875
Well done!

153
00:07:49,875 --> 00:07:52,512
Heh. My goal was to destroy the throne!

154
00:07:57,276 --> 00:07:59,2
Look out, Phoenix Fire!

155
00:08:02,672 --> 00:08:05,619
Heh. You've always been pretty annoying.

156
00:08:05,619 --> 00:08:06,690
Nothing's changed.

157
00:08:06,690 --> 00:08:09,240
You can't even leave a scratch on me!

158
00:08:09,681 --> 00:08:10,891
Wild Guardy!

159
00:08:15,225 --> 00:08:16,136
Wild...

160
00:08:16,136 --> 00:08:17,230
Slash!

161
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:20,821
I see.

162
00:08:25,25 --> 00:08:27,231
Look here, Earthling child- I mean, Jun!

163
00:08:27,231 --> 00:08:28,514
Send me!

164
00:08:28,514 --> 00:08:29,316
Black Hook!

165
00:08:29,316 --> 00:08:32,904
I have a score to settle with him. Now's my chance!

166
00:08:32,904 --> 00:08:33,858
Alright, then!

167
00:08:34,598 --> 00:08:36,266
Black Hook, setup!

168
00:08:40,868 --> 00:08:41,841
Hey!

169
00:08:45,194 --> 00:08:46,327
Hey, bookie boy!

170
00:08:48,293 --> 00:08:49,832
Wild Guardy! Come back!

171
00:08:50,792 --> 00:08:54,457
Black Hook. You've become enslaved to this kiddo, I see.

172
00:08:54,457 --> 00:08:58,76
He only means that anyone can turn from an enemy into a friend!

173
00:08:58,76 --> 00:09:00,455
Black Hook! Captain's Cannon!

174
00:09:01,342 --> 00:09:03,474
Captain's...

175
00:09:03,474 --> 00:09:04,282
Do it.

176
00:09:04,733 --> 00:09:06,695
Cannon!

177
00:09:12,795 --> 00:09:13,336
Is he done?!

178
00:09:13,336 --> 00:09:15,93
Don't say that, you'll jinx it!

179
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:21,989
I see. As powerful as ever.

180
00:09:21,989 --> 00:09:22,750
I told you!

181
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:24,494
He's too stubborn!

182
00:09:24,494 --> 00:09:28,585
So. Shall I finish it off now?

183
00:09:31,273 --> 00:09:32,284
That doesn't look good.

184
00:09:32,284 --> 00:09:33,416
Send me out there!

185
00:09:34,528 --> 00:09:36,939
Mega Trucker, Shoulder Shield!

186
00:09:40,118 --> 00:09:42,656
Heh! Not a chance, Heavy Iron!

187
00:09:42,656 --> 00:09:43,472
Do not push yourself.

188
00:09:44,433 --> 00:09:46,509
We'll be helping you again this time!

189
00:09:46,509 --> 00:09:47,668
Yes. Don't worry.

190
00:09:47,668 --> 00:09:49,454
We'll help you this time!

191
00:09:49,454 --> 00:09:50,513
Me too!

192
00:09:50,513 --> 00:09:53,281
Oh, my! What a beautiful sight!

193
00:09:53,281 --> 00:09:56,282
I will give it all I've got!

194
00:09:56,282 --> 00:09:57,760
Okay! Let's join forces!

195
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:00,483
Stop. I think you should stay behind.

196
00:10:00,483 --> 00:10:02,745
You have to protect Jun in case something happens!

197
00:10:02,745 --> 00:10:05,140
Don't worry! We won't lose this time!

198
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:06,152
We'll always...

199
00:10:06,152 --> 00:10:07,184
...be with you!

200
00:10:07,904 --> 00:10:08,982
...okay.

201
00:10:08,982 --> 00:10:10,129
Hey, guys!

202
00:10:10,129 --> 00:10:13,91
Energy Full Charge!

203
00:10:15,611 --> 00:10:19,627
Ultra... Mega Power... Shield!!

204
00:10:21,617 --> 00:10:23,366
Heavy...

205
00:10:23,366 --> 00:10:24,889
Buster...

206
00:10:24,889 --> 00:10:27,419
Cannon!!

207
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:46,372
OMG, what's that?!

208
00:10:46,372 --> 00:10:47,313
Jun!!

209
00:10:47,313 --> 00:10:49,779
Jun? What do you mean?!

210
00:10:55,552 --> 00:10:57,15
We did it...?

211
00:10:57,453 --> 00:11:00,850
I told you... we were going to win...

212
00:11:06,771 --> 00:11:10,386
Haha... I guess I'm done now...

213
00:11:10,986 --> 00:11:11,910
Hey, guys...?

214
00:11:13,144 --> 00:11:15,665
So, do you understand...

215
00:11:15,665 --> 00:11:19,143
the difference in power between me and you brats?!

216
00:11:19,143 --> 00:11:23,9
Soon... this will become our second home planet.

217
00:11:23,9 --> 00:11:26,784
The Earth will generate an endless supply of core metal.

218
00:11:26,784 --> 00:11:32,188
And I will save our people of steel from the threat of extinction!
