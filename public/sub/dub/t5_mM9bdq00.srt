00:00:01,618 --> 00:00:04,982
Showdown Between Blue Cop and Wild Guardy!

2
00:00:07,588 --> 00:00:09,645
You ready for this?

3
00:00:09,645 --> 00:00:11,297
Just go ahead and shoot!

4
00:00:15,399 --> 00:00:17,46
Woah!

5
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:18,937
Here it comes!

6
00:00:25,264 --> 00:00:26,567
Wow!

7
00:00:27,212 --> 00:00:29,373
Thank you, thank you.

8
00:00:29,373 --> 00:00:30,546
Those are amazing skills.

9
00:00:30,546 --> 00:00:32,146
Never misses a shot.

10
00:00:32,146 --> 00:00:36,15
He's a hunter in the wild who never ever misses a mark!

11
00:00:37,337 --> 00:00:40,583
Fleta Z, welcome to the team!

12
00:00:40,583 --> 00:00:42,640
Once again, thank you for joining us!

13
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:44,345
Thank you for having me, Jun.

14
00:00:45,708 --> 00:00:46,860
Huh?

15
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:48,905
What's with Mega Trucker's head?

16
00:00:50,857 --> 00:00:52,318
Aah!

17
00:00:58,457 --> 00:01:00,646
I am terribly sorry about this.

18
00:01:00,646 --> 00:01:03,326
It's fine. It's nothing, really.

19
00:01:06,57 --> 00:01:07,209
Crest?

20
00:01:07,209 --> 00:01:09,3
Just as I thought. You're all here.

21
00:01:10,495 --> 00:01:12,616
What brings you guys here?

22
00:01:13,923 --> 00:01:15,687
Hm. I see it's been sealed.

23
00:01:15,687 --> 00:01:17,788
I have kept my promise!

24
00:01:17,788 --> 00:01:19,997
It's your turn to tell me what I want to know.

25
00:01:19,997 --> 00:01:20,793
What is it?

26
00:01:20,793 --> 00:01:25,151
Tell me everything about you and Wild Guardy! I wanna know everything!

27
00:01:25,151 --> 00:01:26,608
I would like to know too.

28
00:01:31,555 --> 00:01:33,894
Alright. Where should we begin?

29
00:01:33,894 --> 00:01:37,22
How about when you used to be a Star Guardian of Machina planet?

30
00:01:37,22 --> 00:01:38,749
Star Guardian...?

31
00:01:38,749 --> 00:01:39,969
What is that?

32
00:01:39,969 --> 00:01:45,589
An elite force was selected to guard Deus Machina, the modern computer of Machina planet.

33
00:01:45,589 --> 00:01:52,480
Blue Cop... was the best Metal Cardbot of them all.

34
00:01:52,480 --> 00:02:00,668
I vowed to become a great Star Guardian just like Blue Cop.

35
00:02:00,668 --> 00:02:01,623
However,

36
00:02:01,623 --> 00:02:05,603
My dream was crushed when Machina planet was destroyed.

37
00:02:05,603 --> 00:02:09,487
I just managed to escape and was lost in the vastness of outer space.

38
00:02:10,38 --> 00:02:13,784
After a long period of wandering, Wild Guardy crashed onto Earth.

39
00:02:13,784 --> 00:02:14,623
Crashed?

40
00:02:14,623 --> 00:02:16,731
Did your escape pod malfunction?

41
00:02:16,731 --> 00:02:18,735
We don't know.

42
00:02:18,735 --> 00:02:22,151
He was in a terrible state when I found him.

43
00:02:28,328 --> 00:02:30,458
Master! This looks like...

44
00:02:30,458 --> 00:02:33,749
Sebastian. Turn the car around. Let's take him to the villa.

45
00:02:33,749 --> 00:02:34,720
Uh- yes, Master!

46
00:02:38,597 --> 00:02:41,608
Fortunately, the villa was equipped with everything we needed for repairs,

47
00:02:41,608 --> 00:02:46,381
because my dad is the CEO of a car company, and my mom a doctor of robot engineering.

48
00:03:06,591 --> 00:03:09,88
We didn't even share a language then.

49
00:03:09,88 --> 00:03:12,12
But we shared a genuine connection.

50
00:03:26,96 --> 00:03:28,547
So this... is planet Earth?

51
00:03:28,547 --> 00:03:31,827
Yeah. It is where I was born and raised.

52
00:03:35,278 --> 00:03:36,942
So... what's your name?

53
00:03:36,942 --> 00:03:39,65
It's Wild Guardy... in your language.

54
00:03:39,65 --> 00:03:41,23
I'm Crest.

55
00:03:41,23 --> 00:03:41,920
Let's be friends.

56
00:03:45,794 --> 00:03:48,909
So... Crest is the one who saved you, Wild Guardy?

57
00:03:48,909 --> 00:03:52,730
Yes. He is also a precious friend that I found on this planet.

58
00:03:52,730 --> 00:03:54,404
A friend?

59
00:03:54,404 --> 00:03:58,441
Then we saw on the news that mysterious robots have been showing up in Mowtown.

60
00:03:58,441 --> 00:03:59,864
We knew right away.

61
00:03:59,864 --> 00:04:04,531
They had to be Metal Cardbots from Machina planet, just like Wild Guardy.

62
00:04:04,531 --> 00:04:07,655
So, Crest... the reason you transferred here was...

63
00:04:07,655 --> 00:04:10,728
That's right. It was to find out who you guys were.

64
00:04:10,728 --> 00:04:13,792
Although Machina planet is gone, I can still prove

65
00:04:13,792 --> 00:04:17,961
that I am better than a Star Guardian if I can beat Blue Cop!

66
00:04:17,961 --> 00:04:20,756
That is beyond obsessed, bro.

67
00:04:20,756 --> 00:04:23,425
You are basically stalking Blue Cop here!

68
00:04:23,425 --> 00:04:27,480
It might be better for you to spread your wings and fly on your own.

69
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:30,442
You simpletons have no clue about the loneliness and thoughts

70
00:04:30,442 --> 00:04:32,792
of someone with the dream of becoming the best!

71
00:04:32,792 --> 00:04:33,962
What?!

72
00:04:33,962 --> 00:04:39,757
I will rise above the Star Guardian and become king of the Metal Cardbots!

73
00:04:39,757 --> 00:04:42,502
What is this guy even going on about?!

74
00:04:42,502 --> 00:04:44,709
If that's what you want...

75
00:04:44,709 --> 00:04:46,396
I will give you a chance.

76
00:04:46,396 --> 00:04:47,92
What?!

77
00:04:47,92 --> 00:04:47,759
Huh?

78
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:51,515
Yeah! In return, you have to promise to join our team if you lose.

79
00:04:51,515 --> 00:04:53,310
Sounds fun.

80
00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:55,342
Take them on, Wild Guardy.

81
00:04:55,342 --> 00:04:56,462
I'm sorry, what?

82
00:04:56,462 --> 00:04:57,855
Crest, not you too...

83
00:04:57,855 --> 00:05:02,795
But... if you lose, you have to hand over the Metal Breath. Do you accept?

84
00:05:02,795 --> 00:05:03,734
Yes!

85
00:05:03,734 --> 00:05:05,627
No! You mustn't, Jun.

86
00:05:05,627 --> 00:05:07,759
Are you afraid, Blue Cop?

87
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:09,15
No, I just think that-

88
00:05:09,15 --> 00:05:16,237
You are definitely not having this battle in my car repair shop, got it?!

89
00:05:16,237 --> 00:05:18,773
I think we better move, Crest...

90
00:05:18,773 --> 00:05:22,409
Yeah, actually... I know the perfect place. Follow me, please.

91
00:05:39,595 --> 00:05:40,492
Alright!

92
00:05:40,492 --> 00:05:41,408
Shall we begin?

93
00:05:45,754 --> 00:05:47,60
Metal Breath, pickup!

94
00:05:49,195 --> 00:05:50,521
Mega Trucker, setup!

95
00:05:53,794 --> 00:05:55,34
Wait, what?

96
00:05:55,34 --> 00:05:56,338
That's not Blue Cop!

97
00:05:56,338 --> 00:05:58,578
I said we'll take you on!

98
00:05:58,578 --> 00:06:00,920
But I never said it would be a one on one battle!

99
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:05,243
If you want the Metal Breath, you will have to get past all of us first!

100
00:06:05,243 --> 00:06:06,608
What?!

101
00:06:06,608 --> 00:06:11,593
Don't worry about it. I'm sure you can handle them all.

102
00:06:11,593 --> 00:06:13,163
No doubt about it!

103
00:06:13,163 --> 00:06:15,2
Alright then! Let's begin!

104
00:06:15,2 --> 00:06:15,975
Yes!

105
00:06:15,975 --> 00:06:18,594
Mega Trucker, Mega Power Tackle!

106
00:06:19,236 --> 00:06:23,42
No one can stop the unstoppable! Mega Trucker! Raah!

107
00:06:23,42 --> 00:06:26,747
There's no need to stop you. You can't even touch me.

108
00:06:33,179 --> 00:06:34,96
Next!

109
00:06:34,931 --> 00:06:36,853
Mega Trucker, come back!

110
00:06:37,148 --> 00:06:38,767
That didn't even take ten seconds...

111
00:06:38,767 --> 00:06:40,408
Unbelievable...

112
00:06:40,408 --> 00:06:41,951
Phoenix Fire, your turn!

113
00:06:41,951 --> 00:06:43,28
Yes!

114
00:06:43,28 --> 00:06:44,966
Speed attack! Water Splash!

115
00:06:45,629 --> 00:06:47,185
Water Splash!

116
00:06:49,934 --> 00:06:50,922
Stop right there!

117
00:07:00,606 --> 00:07:01,799
Watch your back!

118
00:07:02,353 --> 00:07:04,344
Wild Slash!

119
00:07:07,442 --> 00:07:09,469
Phoenix Fire, are you alright?

120
00:07:09,469 --> 00:07:10,693
He's too strong...

121
00:07:10,693 --> 00:07:12,554
Jun, you need to stay strong!

122
00:07:12,554 --> 00:07:14,278
I know, Edo.

123
00:07:14,278 --> 00:07:15,988
Your turn, Mega Ambler!

124
00:07:16,589 --> 00:07:19,213
Don't think changing players will change the outcome.

125
00:07:19,213 --> 00:07:21,666
Be a little more polite, kiddo.

126
00:07:21,666 --> 00:07:25,238
Crest is right. I don't want to waste my time.

127
00:07:25,238 --> 00:07:26,484
Just show me what you've got.

128
00:07:26,484 --> 00:07:28,497
He's sure isn't here to make friends!

129
00:07:28,497 --> 00:07:30,296
Pride comes before a fall.

130
00:07:30,296 --> 00:07:32,825
Jun. We are ready whenever you are.

131
00:07:32,825 --> 00:07:35,577
Alright! Well it's time to get him!

132
00:07:35,577 --> 00:07:38,258
Mega Ambler, Forceps Crush!

133
00:07:38,258 --> 00:07:39,548
Forceps Crush!

134
00:07:52,13 --> 00:07:54,915
Shadow X, Spinning Cutter!

135
00:07:54,915 --> 00:07:56,389
Spinning Cutter!

136
00:07:59,967 --> 00:08:02,682
Haha! Watch your head, buddy!

137
00:08:08,76 --> 00:08:08,983
Dexter!

138
00:08:09,407 --> 00:08:10,785
Spear Thrust!

139
00:08:10,896 --> 00:08:12,865
Spear... Thrust!

140
00:08:19,538 --> 00:08:21,780
Wild Slash!

141
00:08:26,350 --> 00:08:28,439
Jun! Send me out there!

142
00:08:28,525 --> 00:08:31,346
I always win no matter who you send!

143
00:08:31,346 --> 00:08:32,843
Fleta Z, setup-

144
00:08:32,843 --> 00:08:34,271
Hold on, Jun.

145
00:08:34,271 --> 00:08:35,365
Blue Cop?

146
00:08:35,365 --> 00:08:36,780
Send me out this time.

147
00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:38,188
...are you sure?

148
00:08:38,188 --> 00:08:39,130
Yes.

149
00:08:39,130 --> 00:08:41,584
Don't worry, Blue Cop. I can handle it.

150
00:08:41,584 --> 00:08:44,791
That's not the problem. Please. Let me, Fleta Z.

151
00:08:44,791 --> 00:08:47,538
...I understand. Please go ahead.

152
00:08:53,2 --> 00:08:55,302
At last you are here, Blue Cop.

153
00:08:55,302 --> 00:08:59,29
Thought you'd be the finale, but I guess you'd want to fight now.

154
00:08:59,29 --> 00:09:03,702
When Machina planet was destroyed, I was on my own too.

155
00:09:03,702 --> 00:09:07,45
I spent ages wandering through space alone.

156
00:09:07,45 --> 00:09:10,921
When I finally got to this planet, I found my kind again. I don't want them to get hurt.

157
00:09:10,921 --> 00:09:13,181
Save the sob story for someone else.

158
00:09:13,181 --> 00:09:16,394
Just let me defeat them!

159
00:09:17,182 --> 00:09:19,734
I have pulled myself up from the jaws of death!

160
00:09:19,734 --> 00:09:22,234
Working to make myself stronger!

161
00:09:22,234 --> 00:09:25,660
I am the rightful Star Guardian!

162
00:09:28,576 --> 00:09:29,662
Don't you see it?

163
00:09:29,662 --> 00:09:30,571
What?

164
00:09:31,988 --> 00:09:35,486
Blue Cop said he doesn't want his fellow Cardbots to get hurt!

165
00:09:35,486 --> 00:09:38,628
And that includes you, stubborn robot!

166
00:09:39,39 --> 00:09:42,11
Stop acting all high and mighty!

167
00:09:48,322 --> 00:09:51,209
No way... my sword!

168
00:09:51,274 --> 00:09:52,170
Blue Cop!

169
00:09:52,170 --> 00:09:53,745
Let's end this, Jun!

170
00:10:02,381 --> 00:10:04,420
Infinity...

171
00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:05,551
Force...

172
00:10:05,551 --> 00:10:07,136
Break!!

173
00:10:22,575 --> 00:10:24,88
Wild Guardy!

174
00:10:27,15 --> 00:10:28,241
...why...

175
00:10:28,241 --> 00:10:30,702
...why can't I beat him...?

176
00:10:30,702 --> 00:10:33,982
Does this mean I'm not qualified to be a Star Guardian?

177
00:10:33,982 --> 00:10:35,766
That's not true, Wild Guardy.

178
00:10:36,451 --> 00:10:39,101
I don't need your empty words now...!

179
00:10:39,101 --> 00:10:40,458
I mean it.

180
00:10:40,458 --> 00:10:45,71
Deus Machina told me, right before Machina planet collapsed,

181
00:10:45,71 --> 00:10:49,246
to use the Metal Breath, to find a friend.

182
00:10:49,246 --> 00:10:50,759
A friend...?

183
00:10:55,35 --> 00:10:57,106
May I do it? Crest?

184
00:10:59,478 --> 00:11:01,131
