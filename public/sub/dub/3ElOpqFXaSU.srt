The Dancing Dump Truck

2
0:0:14.254867933242798,254 --> 0:0:16.424146935150148,424
Hey, cool moves!

3
0:0:17.32455981880188,324 --> 0:0:18.757320097274782,757
Huh? Who's that?

4
0:0:18.757320097274782,757 --> 0:0:20.618742849319457,618
Hey, you aren't invited here...

5
0:0:24.6312220038147,631 --> 0:0:27.008381952316284,8
Come on, be a good sport and let me in on the fun!

6
0:0:27.137052188827514,137 --> 0:0:34.10460083787537,104
Woohoo! Hahaha!

7
0:0:34.10460083787537,104 --> 0:0:38.57240004196167,572
Huh? Where did you go!?

8
0:0:38.57240004196167,572 --> 0:0:39.869507938964844,869
Ugh...

9
0:0:42.94649589318848,946 --> 0:0:44.83330590463257,833
Save me, brave warrior!

10
0:0:44.83330590463257,833 --> 0:0:49.076877935150144,76
Wahaha! There is no use crying now!

11
0:0:49.076877935150144,76 --> 0:0:52.45476991607666,454
The world belongs to Vance, the evil overlord!

12
0:0:55.74234594468689,742 --> 0:0:59.01988508583069,19
Not so soon, evil overlord Vance!

13
0:0:59.01988508583069,19 --> 0:1:1.4573749542236314,457
Are you Jun, the warrior?

14
0:1:1.4573749542236314,457 --> 0:1:4.300825916076661,300
Agh, how did he get past our ten million men?!

15
0:1:4.300825916076661,300 --> 0:1:7.002372998092653,2
I will have to dish him a lesson myself!

16
0:1:9.1354320743866,135 --> 0:1:11.299290091552734,299
Take them on, Blue Cop!

17
0:1:15.436479837875368,436 --> 0:1:19.765489948501582,765
Aaugh!

18
0:1:21.814995898910524,814 --> 0:1:22.798286935150145,798
Oh, Jun!

19
0:1:25.277239959945675,277 --> 0:1:28.44192107629395,441
At your service, Princess Anna!

20
0:1:28.84096304005432,840 --> 0:1:31.29835905149841,298
Thank you very much, Jun!

21
0:1:34.80586719454956,805 --> 0:1:40.40766688174439,407
Ahh... Princess Anna... one little kiss on this cheek too, please...

22
0:1:41.71869906866455,718 --> 0:1:43.2002550705719,200
Wake up!

23
0:1:44.336689929428104,336 --> 0:1:47.570904900817865,570
Hey, mom... good morning...

24
0:1:47.570904900817865,570 --> 0:1:49.74055614305115,740
Don't you "good morning" me!

25
0:1:49.74055614305115,740 --> 0:1:52.98576802098083,985
You promised to help out at the restaurant, remember?

26
0:1:52.98576802098083,985 --> 0:1:56.07976505149841,79
Right, I just remembered...

27
0:1:58.88832411634827,888 --> 0:2:1.6512540553131174,651
Jun, here's a cheeseburger.

28
0:2:1.6607862193450984,660 --> 0:2:3.4756608722076408,475
Yes, Dad.

29
0:2:3.4756608722076408,475 --> 0:2:4.80451909918213,804
Table number two.

30
0:2:4.80451909918213,804 --> 0:2:6.332898123977657,332
I got it, Dad.

31
0:2:7.798610938964842,798 --> 0:2:10.669483965667723,669
Hey, here's your cheeseburger.

32
0:2:10.669483965667723,669 --> 0:2:13.896241916076661,896
The coffee here is the best in town. I'm not kidding!

33
0:2:13.896241916076661,896 --> 0:2:17.558163055313116,558
That won't get you a refill, officer.

34
0:2:17.558163055313116,558 --> 0:2:19.183748830245975,183
Welcome!

35
0:2:20.173692916076646,173 --> 0:2:22.15670488365174,156
Jun, I think they're here for you.

36
0:2:22.15670488365174,156 --> 0:2:23.63527803623961,635
For me?

37
0:2:23.93309492942811,933 --> 0:2:26.070800917984002,70
Come on in.

38
0:2:26.070800917984002,70 --> 0:2:27.301342910354606,301
Good day, ma'am!

39
0:2:27.301342910354606,301 --> 0:2:29.22913188555907,229
Vance and Lavi?

40
0:2:29.22913188555907,229 --> 0:2:31.269992062942492,269
What are you guys doing here?

41
0:2:31.269992062942492,269 --> 0:2:34.909027024795535,909
What do you mean? This is a restaurant, we're obviously here to eat!

42
0:2:34.909027024795535,909 --> 0:2:37.01371702288819,13
That's not it!

43
0:2:37.01371702288819,13 --> 0:2:39.1774730553131,177
Come here, we need to talk.

44
0:2:39.1774730553131,177 --> 0:2:42.69413206103516,694
Huh? But I'm...

45
0:2:42.69413206103516,694 --> 0:2:48.73692201907349,736
Uh... Welcome, we have a corner table for two right here.

46
0:2:52.3587571411438,358 --> 0:2:54.985118950408946,985
What is it, then?

47
0:2:56.878556954223626,878 --> 0:2:59.85893687602234,858
It's about the robot that took you away.

48
0:2:59.85893687602234,858 --> 0:3:2.574003022888178,574
Uh... what robot?

49
0:3:2.574003022888178,574 --> 0:3:4.194075003814703,194
Don't act coy now!

50
0:3:4.194075003814703,194 --> 0:3:7.690840122070313,690
We know what we saw. On that bridge over the waterway...

51
0:3:18.310084919891352,310 --> 0:3:21.62701809536742,627
Well, it's...

52
0:3:21.62701809536742,627 --> 0:3:24.816850917984,816
Jun. Please keep this a secret between us.

53
0:3:24.816850917984,816 --> 0:3:26.00986991798402,9
Secret?

54
0:3:26.00986991798402,9 --> 0:3:32.05013397329711,50
If people of Earth find out about the Metal Cardbots, they will get frightened. I don't want to cause any trouble.

55
0:3:32.05013397329711,50 --> 0:3:34.440573982833854,440
Don't worry, I promise!

56
0:3:34.440573982833854,440 --> 0:3:36.3539678512268,353
Uhhh...

57
0:3:36.3539678512268,353 --> 0:3:40.29097699237062,290
We're going to middle school next year! It's so crazy!

58
0:3:40.29097699237062,290 --> 0:3:43.07697209536744,76
Anna would laugh at us if we were to go around talking about robots!

59
0:3:43.07697209536744,76 --> 0:3:45.604277887466424,604
Vance did say that last time...

60
0:3:45.604277887466424,604 --> 0:3:48.279404856948844,279
Oh, shut up! I'm leaving!

61
0:3:48.279404856948844,279 --> 0:3:51.62525196757508,625
B-but Vance! Don't you want to eat first?!

62
0:3:54.00239176348876,2 --> 0:3:55.766561994277964,766
Have a good day, lady...

63
0:3:55.766561994277964,766 --> 0:3:58.003670095367426,3
Hey, don't you want a smoothie before you leave?

64
0:3:58.003670095367426,3 --> 0:4:0.36359813351441517,363
Yeah, can I have a strawberry-

65
0:4:0.36359813351441517,363 --> 0:4:1.764325973297133,764
Hurry up!

66
0:4:1.764325973297133,764 --> 0:4:4.735136154495251,735
Ah, maybe next time... wait up, Vance!

67
0:4:4.735136154495251,735 --> 0:4:6.747783112533568,747
Huh? What were they here for?

68
0:4:6.747783112533568,747 --> 0:4:8.45927710108947,459
I have no idea...

69
0:4:8.45927710108947,459 --> 0:4:11.99942091989135,999
A giant robot has been seen in a carpark under an overpass last night.

70
0:4:11.99942091989135,999 --> 0:4:14.063482811172491,63
A giant robot?

71
0:4:14.063482811172491,63 --> 0:4:17.170495876022358,170
This video has caused uproar on the Internet.

72
0:4:17.170495876022358,170 --> 0:4:20.737935175476082,737
According to an eyewitness, a dump truck approached him and his friends...

73
0:4:20.737935175476082,737 --> 0:4:22.870639019073508,870
That's...

74
0:4:22.870639019073508,870 --> 0:4:27.43568895994565,435
Wow, that video looks so real. You can do a lot with CGI these days.

75
0:4:27.43568895994565,435 --> 0:4:30.270892043869026,270
Yeah... it looks like a movie...

76
0:4:30.270892043869026,270 --> 0:4:34.829675129699694,829
I heard the new Max Force movie is coming out soon. Let's say I take you to watch it?

77
0:4:34.829675129699694,829 --> 0:4:36.96165802670288,961
Oh, oh, my dear!

78
0:4:36.96165802670288,961 --> 0:4:39.630477891281146,630
Yes- oh, oh no no!

79
0:4:39.630477891281146,630 --> 0:4:41.4390699599457,439
This is coming out of your pay this month!

80
0:4:41.4390699599457,439 --> 0:4:43.22092910299682,220
No, not again!

81
0:4:51.42225318692016,422 --> 0:4:54.319860068664525,319
No doubt about it. That's Mega Trucker.

82
0:4:54.319860068664525,319 --> 0:4:55.50979300572203,509
Right?

83
0:4:55.50979300572203,509 --> 0:4:59.17634589700316,176
I told him so many times to lay low and not be seen by the people on Earth.

84
0:4:59.17634589700316,176 --> 0:5:3.035636030517594,35
What are you going to do? This already has a million views, it's gone viral!

85
0:5:3.035636030517594,35 --> 0:5:5.3389308168945036,338
He won't listen to me anyway.

86
0:5:5.3389308168945036,338 --> 0:5:7.302526011444115,302
We'll just have to put him under a seal.

87
0:5:7.302526011444115,302 --> 0:5:9.170077877929714,170
A seal?

88
0:5:9.170077877929714,170 --> 0:5:15.654784916076665,654
You can seal a Metal Cardbot in its Metal Card using the power of the Metal Breath.

89
0:5:15.654784916076665,654 --> 0:5:18.95876096566775,958
In the meantime, I have to go talk to Mega Trucker once more.

90
0:5:18.95876096566775,958 --> 0:5:22.890973948501596,890
Yeah, but to do that, we have to go find him first...

91
0:5:24.509457889373778,509 --> 0:5:27.590249024795526,590
Right. Can you procure a large speaker?

92
0:5:27.590249024795526,590 --> 0:5:28.555296013351438,555
A speaker?

93
0:5:28.555296013351438,555 --> 0:5:30.527731097274796,527
I think I have an idea.

94
0:5:36.29840293133543,298 --> 0:5:41.31027401144411,310
I guess I'm awake now. This will be over before school, right?

95
0:5:41.31027401144411,310 --> 0:5:45.26104098664854,261
For this plan to work, we have to do it when no one's watching, and while it's quiet.

96
0:5:45.26104098664854,261 --> 0:5:47.41234898855589,412
I'll make you coffee if you're sleepy.

97
0:5:47.41234898855589,412 --> 0:5:54.66846585694884,668
I'm too young to drink coffee- wait, you know how to make coffee?

98
0:5:54.66846585694884,668 --> 0:6:0.6933990247955535,693
Mega Trucker loves music. His favorite is Musica Latina.

99
0:6:0.6933990247955535,693 --> 0:6:3.263989965667747,263
He can't help but dance when he hears that sound.

100
0:6:3.263989965667747,263 --> 0:6:5.02563607057192,25
How about that?

101
0:6:6.330123902725234,330 --> 0:6:7.987706011444118,987
That's perfect.

102
0:6:16.199986047683694,199 --> 0:6:17.64293487030028,642
Let's turn up the volume.

103
0:6:17.64293487030028,642 --> 0:6:18.869578998092663,869
Alright.

104
0:6:24.282735064849874,282 --> 0:6:26.474981883651708,474
Don't you think this is too much?

105
0:6:26.474981883651708,474 --> 0:6:28.03639496566774,36
Not loud enough.

106
0:6:45.333869043869015,333 --> 0:6:49.13305688365176,133
Woohoo! This is just my kind of music!

107
0:6:49.13305688365176,133 --> 0:6:50.93811897138977,938
He actually showed up?!

108
0:6:50.93811897138977,938 --> 0:6:52.79156994277952,791
Let me in on the fun!

109
0:6:56.6695948893738,669 --> 0:6:58.20541504196166,205
Hehehe!

110
0:7:1.8011129561309644,801 --> 0:7:5.875932990463241,875
This is great! Step on the gas and let's dance the night away!

111
0:7:8.531103927520746,531 --> 0:7:12.525733948501568,525
Mega Trucker! I told you to lay low and not be seen by anyone!

112
0:7:12.525733948501568,525 --> 0:7:14.00799290272522,7
Why can't you listen?!

113
0:7:15.233152108718855,233 --> 0:7:20.542799971389798,542
You can be boring if you want! I'll live my life dancing and having fun!

114
0:7:22.290379003814678,290 --> 0:7:23.904602870300266,904
Jun, careful!

115
0:7:28.24413600190735,244 --> 0:7:30.626516952316308,626
Hey! Bring the music back!

116
0:7:31.12052497520449,120 --> 0:7:33.59804012016298,598
I can't let you destroy Edo's repair shop!

117
0:7:33.95576398855593,955 --> 0:7:36.07898483978272,78
Who's this kid, anyway?

118
0:7:39.34069691035461,340 --> 0:7:46.70732484741211,707
We have lost our home planet and have no choice but to live here! We must learn to live with the natives, like this boy!

119
0:7:46.70732484741211,707 --> 0:7:50.1715011144409,171
Shut up! Don't you tell me what to do ever again!

120
0:7:54.593077190734846,593 --> 0:7:55.72630911444094,726
Blue Cop!

121
0:7:59.48954890653994,489 --> 0:8:1.4570320228881997,457
Blue Cop! Are you alright?

122
0:8:2.76850995613097,768 --> 0:8:6.5211951850128,521
We have no choice. We'll have to fight him to put him under the seal.

123
0:8:6.5211951850128,521 --> 0:8:10.394786935150137,394
Jun! The time has come for us to fight.

124
0:8:13.672718921798719,672 --> 0:8:19.077594083923316,77
So it's come to this. Stay calm... what should I do?

125
0:8:19.077594083923316,77 --> 0:8:21.2355841010895,235
Mega Power Tackle!

126
0:8:22.134404123977674,134 --> 0:8:23.549919125885026,549
Look out, Blue Cop!

127
0:8:28.370389017166133,370 --> 0:8:29.268348940872215,268
Jun, now!

128
0:8:32.7837981735687,783 --> 0:8:34.36571105531311,365
Blue Cop, setup!

129
0:8:54.12095379782102,120 --> 0:8:56.76176709536742,761
Huh? So you know how to hide!

130
0:9:0.06988490653986901,69 --> 0:9:1.815767917983976,815
Uhh... Thunderbolt Smash!

131
0:9:1.815767917983976,815 --> 0:9:4.097647954223589,97
Thunderbolt Smaaaa-

132
0:9:7.5788868989104685,578 --> 0:9:9.68955300953678,689
Uhh..huhh... sorry...

133
0:9:9.68955300953678,689 --> 0:9:13.002593942779527,2
Hahaha! You're pathetic!

134
0:9:13.948322944686879,948 --> 0:9:16.811269074386587,811
After all that talk, you can't do anything, can you?

135
0:9:16.811269074386587,811 --> 0:9:17.571964095367434,571
Blue Cop!

136
0:9:17.849261967575103,849 --> 0:9:21.241438019073485,241
Jun, I'm okay! Just give me the next command!

137
0:9:23.006109129699666,6 --> 0:9:25.414373127792373,414
Blue Cop, Burst Shot!

138
0:9:26.659400961853066,659 --> 0:9:28.293062914169354,293
Burst Shot!

139
0:9:32.08126209918214,81 --> 0:9:33.51148187983699,511
Great!

140
0:9:33.51148187983699,511 --> 0:9:36.237382824523934,237
Burst Shot, Burst Shot, Burst Shot!

141
0:9:45.661304950408976,661 --> 0:9:47.5055630457764,505
One last shot!

142
0:9:48.97470886648557,974 --> 0:9:51.87698107438655,876
Megavolt Punch!

143
0:9:53.468049895095874,468 --> 0:10:0.5115839961853226,511
Megavolt...

144
0:10:0.5115839961853226,511 --> 0:10:2.7128039485015734,712
Punch!!

145
0:10:9.793200992370657,793 --> 0:10:11.84987608010863,849
Jun, seal it now!

146
0:10:11.84987608010863,849 --> 0:10:14.265359942779583,265
Now? Alright...

147
0:10:16.167504135421723,167 --> 0:10:19.815520948501558,815
Metal Cardbot... Chain Shot!

148
0:10:37.095302929428044,95 --> 0:10:39.82568984550471,825
Mega Trucker... seal!

149
0:10:41.85968786457829,859 --> 0:10:44.07773601144413,77
Well done, Jun. You did it.

150
0:10:45.31059917166135,310 --> 0:10:47.91108492752073,911
Mega Trucker really turned into a card...

151
0:10:47.91108492752073,911 --> 0:10:52.49426817929077,494
Yes. It's been sealed in the Metal Breath as Metal Card.

152
0:10:52.49426817929077,494 --> 0:10:56.46146980354308,461
You can summon Mega Trucker any time you want with that card,

153
0:10:56.46146980354308,461 --> 0:10:58.912649937057495,912
and give him commands too.

154
0:11:1.600729005722087,600 --> 0:11:3.936904938964858,936
What's going on? What happened here?

155
0:11:3.936904938964858,936 --> 0:11:5.728538026702836,728
Uhh...

156
0:11:5.728538026702836,728 --> 0:11:6.663177171661346,663
Uh, Mister Edo...

157
0:11:7.554413971389749,554 --> 0:11:9.46026101716609,460
This is bad...
