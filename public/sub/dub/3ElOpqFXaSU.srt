1
00:00:02,105 --> 00:00:05,50
The Dancing Dump Truck

2
00:00:14,254 --> 00:00:16,424
Hey, cool moves!

3
00:00:17,324 --> 00:00:18,757
Huh? Who's that?

4
00:00:18,757 --> 00:00:20,618
Hey, you aren't invited here...

5
00:00:24,631 --> 00:00:27,8
Come on, be a good sport and let me in on the fun!

6
00:00:27,137 --> 00:00:34,104
Woohoo! Hahaha!

7
00:00:34,104 --> 00:00:38,572
Huh? Where did you go!?

8
00:00:38,572 --> 00:00:39,869
Ugh...

9
00:00:42,946 --> 00:00:44,833
Save me, brave warrior!

10
00:00:44,833 --> 00:00:49,76
Wahaha! There is no use crying now!

11
00:00:49,76 --> 00:00:52,454
The world belongs to Vance, the evil overlord!

12
00:00:55,742 --> 00:00:59,19
Not so soon, evil overlord Vance!

13
00:00:59,19 --> 00:01:01,457
Are you Jun, the warrior?

14
00:01:01,457 --> 00:01:04,300
Agh, how did he get past our ten million men?!

15
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:07,2
I will have to dish him a lesson myself!

16
00:01:09,135 --> 00:01:11,299
Take them on, Blue Cop!

17
00:01:15,436 --> 00:01:19,765
Aaugh!

18
00:01:21,814 --> 00:01:22,798
Oh, Jun!

19
00:01:25,277 --> 00:01:28,441
At your service, Princess Anna!

20
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:31,298
Thank you very much, Jun!

21
00:01:34,805 --> 00:01:40,407
Ahh... Princess Anna... one little kiss on this cheek too, please...

22
00:01:41,718 --> 00:01:43,200
Wake up!

23
00:01:44,336 --> 00:01:47,570
Hey, mom... good morning...

24
00:01:47,570 --> 00:01:49,740
Don't you "good morning" me!

25
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:52,985
You promised to help out at the restaurant, remember?

26
00:01:52,985 --> 00:01:56,79
Right, I just remembered...

27
00:01:58,888 --> 00:02:01,651
Jun, here's a cheeseburger.

28
00:02:01,660 --> 00:02:03,475
Yes, Dad.

29
00:02:03,475 --> 00:02:04,804
Table number two.

30
00:02:04,804 --> 00:02:06,332
I got it, Dad.

31
00:02:07,798 --> 00:02:10,669
Hey, here's your cheeseburger.

32
00:02:10,669 --> 00:02:13,896
The coffee here is the best in town. I'm not kidding!

33
00:02:13,896 --> 00:02:17,558
That won't get you a refill, officer.

34
00:02:17,558 --> 00:02:19,183
Welcome!

35
00:02:20,173 --> 00:02:22,156
Jun, I think they're here for you.

36
00:02:22,156 --> 00:02:23,635
For me?

37
00:02:23,933 --> 00:02:26,70
Come on in.

38
00:02:26,70 --> 00:02:27,301
Good day, ma'am!

39
00:02:27,301 --> 00:02:29,229
Vance and Lavi?

40
00:02:29,229 --> 00:02:31,269
What are you guys doing here?

41
00:02:31,269 --> 00:02:34,909
What do you mean? This is a restaurant, we're obviously here to eat!

42
00:02:34,909 --> 00:02:37,13
That's not it!

43
00:02:37,13 --> 00:02:39,177
Come here, we need to talk.

44
00:02:39,177 --> 00:02:42,694
Huh? But I'm...

45
00:02:42,694 --> 00:02:48,736
Uh... Welcome, we have a corner table for two right here.

46
00:02:52,358 --> 00:02:54,985
What is it, then?

47
00:02:56,878 --> 00:02:59,858
It's about the robot that took you away.

48
00:02:59,858 --> 00:03:02,574
Uh... what robot?

49
00:03:02,574 --> 00:03:04,194
Don't act coy now!

50
00:03:04,194 --> 00:03:07,690
We know what we saw. On that bridge over the waterway...

51
00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:21,627
Well, it's...

52
00:03:21,627 --> 00:03:24,816
Jun. Please keep this a secret between us.

53
00:03:24,816 --> 00:03:26,9
Secret?

54
00:03:26,9 --> 00:03:32,50
If people of Earth find out about the Metal Cardbots, they will get frightened. I don't want to cause any trouble.

55
00:03:32,50 --> 00:03:34,440
Don't worry, I promise!

56
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:36,353
Uhhh...

57
00:03:36,353 --> 00:03:40,290
We're going to middle school next year! It's so crazy!

58
00:03:40,290 --> 00:03:43,76
Anna would laugh at us if we were to go around talking about robots!

59
00:03:43,76 --> 00:03:45,604
Vance did say that last time...

60
00:03:45,604 --> 00:03:48,279
Oh, shut up! I'm leaving!

61
00:03:48,279 --> 00:03:51,625
B-but Vance! Don't you want to eat first?!

62
00:03:54,2 --> 00:03:55,766
Have a good day, lady...

63
00:03:55,766 --> 00:03:58,3
Hey, don't you want a smoothie before you leave?

64
00:03:58,3 --> 00:04:00,363
Yeah, can I have a strawberry-

65
00:04:00,363 --> 00:04:01,764
Hurry up!

66
00:04:01,764 --> 00:04:04,735
Ah, maybe next time... wait up, Vance!

67
00:04:04,735 --> 00:04:06,747
Huh? What were they here for?

68
00:04:06,747 --> 00:04:08,459
I have no idea...

69
00:04:08,459 --> 00:04:11,999
A giant robot has been seen in a carpark under an overpass last night.

70
00:04:11,999 --> 00:04:14,63
A giant robot?

71
00:04:14,63 --> 00:04:17,170
This video has caused uproar on the Internet.

72
00:04:17,170 --> 00:04:20,737
According to an eyewitness, a dump truck approached him and his friends...

73
00:04:20,737 --> 00:04:22,870
That's...

74
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:27,435
Wow, that video looks so real. You can do a lot with CGI these days.

75
00:04:27,435 --> 00:04:30,270
Yeah... it looks like a movie...

76
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:34,829
I heard the new Max Force movie is coming out soon. Let's say I take you to watch it?

77
00:04:34,829 --> 00:04:36,961
Oh, oh, my dear!

78
00:04:36,961 --> 00:04:39,630
Yes- oh, oh no no!

79
00:04:39,630 --> 00:04:41,439
This is coming out of your pay this month!

80
00:04:41,439 --> 00:04:43,220
No, not again!

81
00:04:51,422 --> 00:04:54,319
No doubt about it. That's Mega Trucker.

82
00:04:54,319 --> 00:04:55,509
Right?

83
00:04:55,509 --> 00:04:59,176
I told him so many times to lay low and not be seen by the people on Earth.

84
00:04:59,176 --> 00:05:03,35
What are you going to do? This already has a million views, it's gone viral!

85
00:05:03,35 --> 00:05:05,338
He won't listen to me anyway.

86
00:05:05,338 --> 00:05:07,302
We'll just have to put him under a seal.

87
00:05:07,302 --> 00:05:09,170
A seal?

88
00:05:09,170 --> 00:05:15,654
You can seal a Metal Cardbot in its Metal Card using the power of the Metal Breath.

89
00:05:15,654 --> 00:05:18,958
In the meantime, I have to go talk to Mega Trucker once more.

90
00:05:18,958 --> 00:05:22,890
Yeah, but to do that, we have to go find him first...

91
00:05:24,509 --> 00:05:27,590
Right. Can you procure a large speaker?

92
00:05:27,590 --> 00:05:28,555
A speaker?

93
00:05:28,555 --> 00:05:30,527
I think I have an idea.

94
00:05:36,298 --> 00:05:41,310
I guess I'm awake now. This will be over before school, right?

95
00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:45,261
For this plan to work, we have to do it when no one's watching, and while it's quiet.

96
00:05:45,261 --> 00:05:47,412
I'll make you coffee if you're sleepy.

97
00:05:47,412 --> 00:05:54,668
I'm too young to drink coffee- wait, you know how to make coffee?

98
00:05:54,668 --> 00:06:00,693
Mega Trucker loves music. His favorite is Musica Latina.

99
00:06:00,693 --> 00:06:03,263
He can't help but dance when he hears that sound.

100
00:06:03,263 --> 00:06:05,25
How about that?

101
00:06:06,330 --> 00:06:07,987
That's perfect.

102
00:06:16,199 --> 00:06:17,642
Let's turn up the volume.

103
00:06:17,642 --> 00:06:18,869
Alright.

104
00:06:24,282 --> 00:06:26,474
Don't you think this is too much?

105
00:06:26,474 --> 00:06:28,36
Not loud enough.

106
00:06:45,333 --> 00:06:49,133
Woohoo! This is just my kind of music!

107
00:06:49,133 --> 00:06:50,938
He actually showed up?!

108
00:06:50,938 --> 00:06:52,791
Let me in on the fun!

109
00:06:56,669 --> 00:06:58,205
Hehehe!

110
00:07:01,801 --> 00:07:05,875
This is great! Step on the gas and let's dance the night away!

111
00:07:08,531 --> 00:07:12,525
Mega Trucker! I told you to lay low and not be seen by anyone!

112
00:07:12,525 --> 00:07:14,7
Why can't you listen?!

113
00:07:15,233 --> 00:07:20,542
You can be boring if you want! I'll live my life dancing and having fun!

114
00:07:22,290 --> 00:07:23,904
Jun, careful!

115
00:07:28,244 --> 00:07:30,626
Hey! Bring the music back!

116
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:33,598
I can't let you destroy Edo's repair shop!

117
00:07:33,955 --> 00:07:36,78
Who's this kid, anyway?

118
00:07:39,340 --> 00:07:46,707
We have lost our home planet and have no choice but to live here! We must learn to live with the natives, like this boy!

119
00:07:46,707 --> 00:07:50,171
Shut up! Don't you tell me what to do ever again!

120
00:07:54,593 --> 00:07:55,726
Blue Cop!

121
00:07:59,489 --> 00:08:01,457
Blue Cop! Are you alright?

122
00:08:02,768 --> 00:08:06,521
We have no choice. We'll have to fight him to put him under the seal.

123
00:08:06,521 --> 00:08:10,394
Jun! The time has come for us to fight.

124
00:08:13,672 --> 00:08:19,77
So it's come to this. Stay calm... what should I do?

125
00:08:19,77 --> 00:08:21,235
Mega Power Tackle!

126
00:08:22,134 --> 00:08:23,549
Look out, Blue Cop!

127
00:08:28,370 --> 00:08:29,268
Jun, now!

128
00:08:32,783 --> 00:08:34,365
Blue Cop, setup!

129
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:56,761
Huh? So you know how to hide!

130
00:09:00,69 --> 00:09:01,815
Uhh... Thunderbolt Smash!

131
00:09:01,815 --> 00:09:04,97
Thunderbolt Smaaaa-

132
00:09:07,578 --> 00:09:09,689
Uhh..huhh... sorry...

133
00:09:09,689 --> 00:09:13,2
Hahaha! You're pathetic!

134
00:09:13,948 --> 00:09:16,811
After all that talk, you can't do anything, can you?

135
00:09:16,811 --> 00:09:17,571
Blue Cop!

136
00:09:17,849 --> 00:09:21,241
Jun, I'm okay! Just give me the next command!

137
00:09:23,6 --> 00:09:25,414
Blue Cop, Burst Shot!

138
00:09:26,659 --> 00:09:28,293
Burst Shot!

139
00:09:32,81 --> 00:09:33,511
Great!

140
00:09:33,511 --> 00:09:36,237
Burst Shot, Burst Shot, Burst Shot!

141
00:09:45,661 --> 00:09:47,505
One last shot!

142
00:09:48,974 --> 00:09:51,876
Megavolt Punch!

143
00:09:53,468 --> 00:10:00,511
Megavolt...

144
00:10:00,511 --> 00:10:02,712
Punch!!

145
00:10:09,793 --> 00:10:11,849
Jun, seal it now!

146
00:10:11,849 --> 00:10:14,265
Now? Alright...

147
00:10:16,167 --> 00:10:19,815
Metal Cardbot... Change Up!

148
00:10:37,95 --> 00:10:39,825
Mega Trucker... seal!

149
00:10:41,859 --> 00:10:44,77
Well done, Jun. You did it.

150
00:10:45,310 --> 00:10:47,911
Mega Trucker really turned into a card...

151
00:10:47,911 --> 00:10:52,494
Yes. It's been sealed in the Metal Breath as Metal Card.

152
00:10:52,494 --> 00:10:56,461
You can summon Mega Trucker any time you want with that card,

153
00:10:56,461 --> 00:10:58,912
and give him commands too.

154
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,936
What's going on? What happened here?

155
00:11:03,936 --> 00:11:05,728
Uhh...

156
00:11:05,728 --> 00:11:06,663
Uh, Mister Edo...

157
00:11:07,554 --> 00:11:09,460
This is bad...
