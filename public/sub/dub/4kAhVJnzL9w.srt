1
00:00:01,543 --> 00:00:04,532
The Vagabond in the Sky

2
00:00:06,237 --> 00:00:08,840
W-What is going on now?!

3
00:00:09,51 --> 00:00:12,251
Have you also been sealed by the Metal Breath?

4
00:00:12,251 --> 00:00:13,84
No.

5
00:00:14,339 --> 00:00:16,602
I see you want freedom too, just like me.

6
00:00:16,602 --> 00:00:17,765
Nice to meet y-

7
00:00:18,547 --> 00:00:20,575
I am nothing like you! Make no mistake!

8
00:00:20,575 --> 00:00:24,849
I will soon be the king of the Metal Cardbots!

9
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:28,829
I see no reason to fight with an unsealed Metal Cardbot.

10
00:00:28,829 --> 00:00:30,960
I will be back for the Metal Breath.

11
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:31,909
So be prepared!

12
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:35,385
Wait up!

13
00:00:35,886 --> 00:00:37,558
This is all your fault!

14
00:00:37,558 --> 00:00:40,962
You are too weak to be the owner of the Metal Breath!

15
00:00:40,962 --> 00:00:42,982
That's why Blue Cop was beaten!

16
00:00:43,569 --> 00:00:46,250
I think you've gone too far, Wild Guardy.

17
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:46,950
Crest?

18
00:00:51,639 --> 00:00:55,180
Jun. You said the Metal Breath was a token of friendship.

19
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:56,641
Yes. It is!

20
00:00:56,641 --> 00:01:01,46
If you are truly united in your friendship, you'll be able to seal Fleta Z.

21
00:01:01,46 --> 00:01:03,926
Then, you can prove what you said was true.

22
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:09,605
Wait up, Crest! I still have questions for you!

23
00:01:10,616 --> 00:01:12,434
What is the matter with him...

24
00:01:12,434 --> 00:01:14,914
Anyway... what should we do with her...?

25
00:01:14,914 --> 00:01:18,554
...Ha, everyone, get in line... I'll sign autographs...

26
00:01:20,798 --> 00:01:23,21
So you're saying... you sent Vera home safe?

27
00:01:23,21 --> 00:01:26,885
Yeah. She didn't see that much, so I think we could make up an excuse.

28
00:01:26,885 --> 00:01:28,391
What about Crest?

29
00:01:28,391 --> 00:01:30,40
We still can't reach him.

30
00:01:30,40 --> 00:01:33,814
We went to his house, but it seems like he's not home yet.

31
00:01:33,814 --> 00:01:37,751
However... Crest knew all about the Metal Cardbots.

32
00:01:37,751 --> 00:01:38,556
What?

33
00:01:38,556 --> 00:01:40,633
He knew everything about them but didn't tell!

34
00:01:40,633 --> 00:01:42,608
He was mocking us all this time!

35
00:01:42,608 --> 00:01:45,679
We did act like we didn't know too...

36
00:01:45,679 --> 00:01:49,513
I'm sure in time we'll get a chance to talk it through properly...

37
00:01:51,168 --> 00:01:53,457
Jun. The emergency treatments are done.

38
00:01:56,781 --> 00:02:00,20
Everyone was attacked where their defense was the weakest.

39
00:02:00,20 --> 00:02:02,655
Does that mean he's that skilled at the bow?

40
00:02:02,655 --> 00:02:05,583
Or maybe that it knows all of our weaknesses?!

41
00:02:05,583 --> 00:02:08,374
But hey! We've never even met the guy!

42
00:02:08,374 --> 00:02:10,723
Yeah. I didn't recognize his face...

43
00:02:10,723 --> 00:02:13,934
Neither did I. But I think... I've heard rumors.

44
00:02:13,934 --> 00:02:15,263
What rumors?

45
00:02:15,263 --> 00:02:20,267
Fleta Z. A roaming vagabond, living as free as the wind.

46
00:02:20,267 --> 00:02:22,924
Also known as the Hunter in the Wilderness.

47
00:02:22,924 --> 00:02:26,619
I heard he does not like to show himself to others, and lives alone,

48
00:02:26,619 --> 00:02:29,57
enjoying the freedom.

49
00:02:29,683 --> 00:02:33,356
You're told to be careful if you hear a flute playing out of the blue.

50
00:02:33,356 --> 00:02:36,664
It means Fleta Z is aiming at you from afar.

51
00:02:44,383 --> 00:02:46,288
Edo! You startled us!

52
00:02:47,297 --> 00:02:50,980
I-I'm sorry. I was wondering if it would sound like this, haha...

53
00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:54,46
C-Could it... still be lurking somewhere nearby?!

54
00:02:54,46 --> 00:02:57,601
He's probably looking for Jun, since he wants to take the Metal Breath.

55
00:02:57,601 --> 00:03:00,235
But he probably doesn't know I'm here!

56
00:03:00,235 --> 00:03:03,350
If so, he'll surely try to find Jun through Vera.

57
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:04,757
Try calling Vera.

58
00:03:04,757 --> 00:03:07,46
I don't even know her number!

59
00:03:07,46 --> 00:03:08,552
I'll call her right now!

60
00:03:11,258 --> 00:03:12,182
Hello?

61
00:03:12,182 --> 00:03:14,312
Vera? Are you free to talk?

62
00:03:14,312 --> 00:03:15,750
Where are you right now?

63
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:18,122
Why? Why do you need to know? Ugh.

64
00:03:18,122 --> 00:03:19,835
Anyway, get this, Anna!

65
00:03:19,835 --> 00:03:22,743
I'm going to meet the person who sent me the email!

66
00:03:22,743 --> 00:03:26,678
They want to hear my full story where we'll not be disturbed.

67
00:03:26,678 --> 00:03:29,20
I think she's meeting with Fleta Z!

68
00:03:29,20 --> 00:03:29,691
What?

69
00:03:30,905 --> 00:03:32,542
Vera! Where are you?!

70
00:03:32,542 --> 00:03:33,531
Jun?

71
00:03:33,531 --> 00:03:37,914
Uh, yeah... the park near 7th Avenue. They wanted to meet here.

72
00:03:38,449 --> 00:03:40,767
No, I don't know why they want to meet here.

73
00:03:42,148 --> 00:03:45,298
They just told me to wait here, so I'm here!

74
00:03:45,771 --> 00:03:47,527
Aah! L-Look at that!

75
00:03:48,147 --> 00:03:51,221
You want me to run away? Why should I do that?

76
00:03:52,923 --> 00:03:53,888
Aah!

77
00:03:55,728 --> 00:03:57,170
W-What's that?!

78
00:03:57,170 --> 00:03:58,261
Run!

79
00:03:59,148 --> 00:04:00,193
W-what's-

80
00:04:00,193 --> 00:04:01,196
Huh?

81
00:04:01,196 --> 00:04:02,495
Sorry I'm late.

82
00:04:02,495 --> 00:04:04,329
Aah! I remember you!

83
00:04:04,329 --> 00:04:07,214
You're the robot that appeared at the bus stop earlier!

84
00:04:10,681 --> 00:04:13,393
Alerting all pedestrians. This is an emergency.

85
00:04:13,393 --> 00:04:15,161
Please evacuate immediately!

86
00:04:15,161 --> 00:04:17,453
Officer, over here! This robot is-

87
00:04:17,453 --> 00:04:18,906
H-Hey, we need to get out of here!

88
00:04:18,906 --> 00:04:20,182
Get away from there!

89
00:04:22,27 --> 00:04:24,286
Now that's enough, Fleta Z!

90
00:04:26,286 --> 00:04:28,185
We will not let you carry on like this.

91
00:04:28,185 --> 00:04:31,45
I was going to ask Ms. Vera some questions.

92
00:04:31,45 --> 00:04:33,908
But I see you showed up before I had to.

93
00:04:33,908 --> 00:04:35,827
Thank you for making this easier.

94
00:04:35,827 --> 00:04:37,09
Not a chance!

95
00:04:37,09 --> 00:04:40,48
You're not getting the Metal Breath ever, do you understand?!

96
00:04:40,48 --> 00:04:42,855
Not even if it means your friends getting hurt?!

97
00:04:48,477 --> 00:04:49,886
Metal Breath, pickup!

98
00:04:51,670 --> 00:04:53,150
Phoenix Fire, setup!

99
00:04:54,949 --> 00:04:56,681
Block the arrows with Water Splash!

100
00:05:05,4 --> 00:05:07,785
What was that... it's a skill I've never seen before...

101
00:05:07,785 --> 00:05:10,310
Fleta Z and the ground are all wet!

102
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:12,292
Mega Ambler, it's your turn!

103
00:05:12,292 --> 00:05:15,96
Send the Forceps Shock towards the wet ground!

104
00:05:15,96 --> 00:05:16,94
Got it!

105
00:05:18,167 --> 00:05:19,468
Forceps Shock!

106
00:05:23,67 --> 00:05:24,482
We did it!

107
00:05:26,543 --> 00:05:28,947
I'll have to take a strategic retreat...

108
00:05:31,699 --> 00:05:33,812
Come on! He's flying away again!

109
00:05:33,812 --> 00:05:35,242
How strange.

110
00:05:35,242 --> 00:05:36,191
What is it?

111
00:05:36,191 --> 00:05:40,81
He was so cocky then. But so disorganized this time.

112
00:05:42,205 --> 00:05:44,530
Theo? What's up? Is everything okay?

113
00:05:44,530 --> 00:05:46,837
We found out Fleta Z's secret!

114
00:05:46,837 --> 00:05:51,233
Fleta Z analyzed every single video that came up on the Internet.

115
00:05:51,233 --> 00:05:54,82
And also wrote comments on all of them!

116
00:05:54,82 --> 00:05:56,435
"Shadow X's weakness is its propeller.

117
00:05:56,435 --> 00:05:59,126
When that is under attack, its mobility decreases."

118
00:05:59,126 --> 00:06:01,732
"Mega Trucker is heavily reliant on his shield.

119
00:06:01,732 --> 00:06:04,698
Aim for its blind spots for an easy win."

120
00:06:04,698 --> 00:06:08,358
Hm. Fleta Z is a strategic type, huh?

121
00:06:08,358 --> 00:06:12,747
First, analyzing the opponent, and only fighting when they are confident of winning.

122
00:06:12,747 --> 00:06:16,563
Hm. I think I know how we can defeat Fleta Z, ha!

123
00:06:16,563 --> 00:06:16,985
Jun!

124
00:06:18,272 --> 00:06:20,908
I know where Fleta Z is!

125
00:06:20,908 --> 00:06:23,144
Alright! Let's go right now!

126
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:38,614
Do you think Jun will pull it off?

127
00:06:38,614 --> 00:06:40,585
We'll find out soon enough.

128
00:06:45,856 --> 00:06:46,641
Hm?

129
00:06:49,933 --> 00:06:51,857
So you managed to find me.

130
00:06:52,151 --> 00:06:53,942
Fleta Z!

131
00:06:53,942 --> 00:06:58,213
The Metal Breath is not some tool to take away the Metal Cardbots' freedom!

132
00:06:58,213 --> 00:06:59,863
Please listen to me!

133
00:06:59,863 --> 00:07:03,351
I don't need to listen. I will not change my mind.

134
00:07:05,1 --> 00:07:07,905
I don't want to have to hurt anyone, either.

135
00:07:07,905 --> 00:07:10,682
Just hand over the Metal Breath, now!

136
00:07:10,682 --> 00:07:13,204
I won't let you take it so easily, you hear?!

137
00:07:19,535 --> 00:07:22,31
Blue Cop, Burst Shot!

138
00:07:23,142 --> 00:07:24,478
Burst Shot!

139
00:07:28,275 --> 00:07:29,449
Beak Arrow!

140
00:07:29,865 --> 00:07:31,189
Transform into a car and dodge!

141
00:07:31,189 --> 00:07:31,956
Got it!

142
00:07:39,381 --> 00:07:41,858
You can't keep running away!

143
00:07:43,608 --> 00:07:46,486
Don't worry! The real fight begins now!

144
00:07:46,486 --> 00:07:47,201
Blue Cop!

145
00:07:53,342 --> 00:07:54,282
Again?!

146
00:07:54,282 --> 00:07:56,44
Now! Shadow X!

147
00:07:56,44 --> 00:07:57,60
What's this?!

148
00:07:57,60 --> 00:07:58,754
What do you think?! A surprise attack!

149
00:07:58,754 --> 00:08:00,309
Spinning Cutter!

150
00:08:04,230 --> 00:08:05,493
Great job!

151
00:08:05,493 --> 00:08:07,413
Mega Ambler! Forceps Shock!

152
00:08:08,567 --> 00:08:10,284
Now you can't use your bow!

153
00:08:10,321 --> 00:08:12,226
Not a chance!

154
00:08:13,386 --> 00:08:14,348
Come back!

155
00:08:16,910 --> 00:08:18,560
Mega Trucker, setup!

156
00:08:19,686 --> 00:08:21,427
Mega Power Tackle!

157
00:08:26,974 --> 00:08:28,820
You have underestimated me.

158
00:08:29,785 --> 00:08:31,750
Vulture Wings!

159
00:08:40,212 --> 00:08:43,346
Making my analysis useless with continued switchups.

160
00:08:43,346 --> 00:08:46,344
And fighting in close proximity so I can't use my arrows.

161
00:08:46,344 --> 00:08:48,61
Great strategy indeed.

162
00:08:48,61 --> 00:08:49,70
However.

163
00:08:49,70 --> 00:08:52,631
I am strong even without the analysis or my bow.

164
00:08:52,631 --> 00:08:56,440
I just did all that because I have a type A personality.

165
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:58,396
I get it that you are strong!

166
00:08:58,396 --> 00:09:01,43
But you will never take the Metal Breath away!

167
00:09:01,43 --> 00:09:03,542
I see you have a stubborn personality.

168
00:09:03,542 --> 00:09:07,588
I became friends with the Metal Cardbots through the Metal Breath!

169
00:09:07,588 --> 00:09:11,856
This is where peaceful coexistence with the people of Earth begins!

170
00:09:11,856 --> 00:09:14,125
It's all very nice to hear, but...

171
00:09:14,125 --> 00:09:16,233
you are just controlling them as you please.

172
00:09:16,233 --> 00:09:17,877
I don't control anyone!

173
00:09:17,877 --> 00:09:20,904
We are just working together for a common goal!

174
00:09:20,904 --> 00:09:25,253
If we work together, we can defeat any enemy, you understand?!

175
00:09:25,253 --> 00:09:26,921
Now Dexter, it's your turn!

176
00:09:30,326 --> 00:09:32,107
Spear Thrust!

177
00:09:38,651 --> 00:09:40,840
A surprise attack from underground... not bad-

178
00:09:43,414 --> 00:09:45,856
Blue Cop! Let's finish the battle now!

179
00:09:52,429 --> 00:09:53,662
Infinity...

180
00:09:53,662 --> 00:09:54,830
Force...

181
00:09:54,830 --> 00:09:56,414
Break!!

182
00:10:07,590 --> 00:10:09,491
Friendship...

183
00:10:09,491 --> 00:10:10,404
working together...

184
00:10:10,404 --> 00:10:12,337
I'll see if that's true...

185
00:10:16,571 --> 00:10:17,806
Awesome!

186
00:10:19,563 --> 00:10:22,485
Metal Cardbot, Chain Shot!

187
00:10:42,83 --> 00:10:43,170
Fleta Z...

188
00:10:43,170 --> 00:10:44,27
seal!

189
00:10:46,35 --> 00:10:47,353
We did it, Jun!

190
00:10:47,353 --> 00:10:49,331
Yeah! All thanks to you!

191
00:10:49,331 --> 00:10:50,830
Hey guys...!

192
00:10:50,830 --> 00:10:54,484
I'm fine over here! Don't worry about me!

193
00:10:54,484 --> 00:10:57,128
Mega Trucker! Are you alright?!

194
00:10:57,128 --> 00:10:59,639
Yeah... I'm okay!

195
00:10:59,639 --> 00:11:01,241
Mega Trucker!!

196
00:11:01,241 --> 00:11:03,679
Don't you think this is proof enough?

197
00:11:03,679 --> 00:11:06,812
That Jun actually has the right to hold the Metal Breath?

198
00:11:06,812 --> 00:11:08,947
I am not ready to accept him.

199
00:11:08,947 --> 00:11:11,660
Haha... you're too strict.

200
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:15,303
Perhaps the time has come for the final showdown,

201
00:11:15,303 --> 00:11:16,383
Jun...
