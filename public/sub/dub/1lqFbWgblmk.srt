1
00:00:01,556 --> 00:00:04,698
Attack of the Final Boss!

2
00:00:08,437 --> 00:00:12,385
Sail, sail, sail... Sail your ship!

3
00:00:12,385 --> 00:00:15,387
Let's go together down the ocea-

4
00:00:17,961 --> 00:00:19,594
What is that?

5
00:00:25,647 --> 00:00:26,446
Huh?

6
00:00:31,974 --> 00:00:33,393
Aah!

7
00:00:47,982 --> 00:00:50,817
Jun seems to be in high spirits today...

8
00:00:50,817 --> 00:00:54,309
He got a new bike from his parents for his birthday...

9
00:00:56,569 --> 00:00:58,922
And that's not all I can do!

10
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:04,302
Oh... so it seems like Anna gave him that scarf, and he's very fond of it.

11
00:01:04,302 --> 00:01:05,523
That's right...

12
00:01:06,213 --> 00:01:09,310
Question. What's a birthday?

13
00:01:09,310 --> 00:01:11,586
It's the day he popped out from his mother's belly.

14
00:01:11,586 --> 00:01:13,705
Popped out from where?

15
00:01:13,705 --> 00:01:15,597
No, no...

16
00:01:15,597 --> 00:01:18,80
It's the day you celebrate your birth into this world.

17
00:01:18,80 --> 00:01:19,481
Ahh...

18
00:01:21,98 --> 00:01:23,809
So... they were celebrating Jun?

19
00:01:23,809 --> 00:01:25,779
Shouldn't we get something for him too?

20
00:01:25,779 --> 00:01:27,32
A... gift?

21
00:01:27,32 --> 00:01:28,634
But I don't have money...?

22
00:01:28,634 --> 00:01:30,835
Hey, what if we save money on fuel...

23
00:01:30,835 --> 00:01:32,463
But fuel prices have gone up!

24
00:01:32,692 --> 00:01:34,598
Hey guys, I have something to discuss with you.

25
00:01:34,646 --> 00:01:35,692
Huh?

26
00:01:41,243 --> 00:01:43,729
This was inside the escape pod we stopped yesterday.

27
00:01:43,729 --> 00:01:45,802
Is it a trailer?

28
00:01:45,802 --> 00:01:48,666
Where's the tractor that transports it?

29
00:01:48,666 --> 00:01:51,147
It will be in the pod that separated and fell into the sea.

30
00:01:51,147 --> 00:01:55,478
So the owner of this trailer was inside the escape pod?

31
00:01:56,557 --> 00:01:57,445
Jun.

32
00:01:57,445 --> 00:02:00,459
Please look up the data in the trailer using the Metal Breath.

33
00:02:01,521 --> 00:02:02,986
...like this?

34
00:02:08,140 --> 00:02:09,858
Data access complete.

35
00:02:12,193 --> 00:02:14,203
Code name: Heavy Iron.

36
00:02:14,203 --> 00:02:15,752
Heavy Iron?!

37
00:02:15,752 --> 00:02:19,79
So he's landed here, then...

38
00:02:19,79 --> 00:02:20,927
Why? What is it?

39
00:02:20,927 --> 00:02:23,762
He's just one scary Metal Cardbot.

40
00:02:23,762 --> 00:02:29,219
The most powerful and evil outlaw that will use brute force to crush anyone he doesn't like!

41
00:02:29,219 --> 00:02:33,482
He will come here looking for the trailer, since it's a part of his body.

42
00:02:33,482 --> 00:02:35,222
We may already be too late then...

43
00:02:36,688 --> 00:02:37,566
Anna!

44
00:02:37,566 --> 00:02:40,11
Late? What do you mean with that?

45
00:02:41,245 --> 00:02:42,695
Take a look here.

46
00:02:44,901 --> 00:02:49,78
Let me see... an oil tanker explodes in the waters near Mowtown.

47
00:02:49,78 --> 00:02:53,261
One survivor said they saw a huge shadowy form swimming in the ocean...

48
00:02:53,261 --> 00:02:55,31
Did it collide into a whale?

49
00:02:55,31 --> 00:02:56,709
No, this is...

50
00:02:56,709 --> 00:02:58,535
Could it be...? Heavy Iron?

51
00:02:58,535 --> 00:02:59,653
For real?!

52
00:03:01,461 --> 00:03:04,911
This is the location where the escape pod landed.

53
00:03:04,911 --> 00:03:07,31
The oil tanker sunk here.

54
00:03:07,31 --> 00:03:10,44
You mean that... it's not headed towards Mowtown?

55
00:03:10,44 --> 00:03:12,668
Let's move the trailer somewhere outside town!

56
00:03:12,668 --> 00:03:14,481
We don't want anyone to get harmed!

57
00:03:14,481 --> 00:03:15,611
Yes.

58
00:03:15,959 --> 00:03:18,95
So... who's going to move it?

59
00:03:24,164 --> 00:03:32,610
Hrgh! I knew this was going to happen! Ugh...

60
00:03:32,610 --> 00:03:36,897
Stop complaining. I'll be sure to see if you are pulling it along, okay?

61
00:03:36,897 --> 00:03:39,745
This trailer is super heavy!

62
00:03:43,871 --> 00:03:45,396
Jun! Over there!

63
00:03:54,842 --> 00:03:56,307
Look here.

64
00:03:56,307 --> 00:03:58,995
Where are you taking my body?

65
00:03:58,995 --> 00:04:00,202
Heavy Iron!

66
00:04:00,202 --> 00:04:01,610
He caught up with us this fast!

67
00:04:01,610 --> 00:04:02,574
Huh?

68
00:04:03,978 --> 00:04:04,639
Ha!

69
00:04:05,53 --> 00:04:07,144
There's an empty construction site there!

70
00:04:07,144 --> 00:04:08,527
Let's go there!

71
00:04:08,527 --> 00:04:11,826
Mega Ambler, Phoenix Fire! Try to keep Heavy Iron here!

72
00:04:11,826 --> 00:04:12,591
Got it!

73
00:04:15,957 --> 00:04:18,234
Come on then, you outlaw...

74
00:04:18,234 --> 00:04:20,417
Yeah! We'll take you on!

75
00:04:20,417 --> 00:04:22,58
Disrespectful runts!

76
00:04:30,527 --> 00:04:33,705
Great job! No one will get harmed out here!

77
00:04:33,705 --> 00:04:36,732
What do we do know? Heavy Iron will be here soon.

78
00:04:36,732 --> 00:04:39,184
Let's hide the trailer in that tunnel first!

79
00:04:40,490 --> 00:04:43,49
You have to enter in reverse mode!

80
00:04:43,49 --> 00:04:44,683
Huh? What do you mean?

81
00:04:44,683 --> 00:04:47,554
It could be hard for you to get out if you go in head first.

82
00:04:47,554 --> 00:04:50,34
I'll watch out for you. Now, hurry!

83
00:04:50,34 --> 00:04:52,152
Ugh, what a bother...

84
00:04:57,555 --> 00:04:59,328
How pathetic.

85
00:05:00,455 --> 00:05:01,249
Stop!

86
00:05:03,229 --> 00:05:04,6
It's coming!

87
00:05:07,512 --> 00:05:08,964
Metal Breath, pickup!

88
00:05:10,758 --> 00:05:12,442
Shadow X, setup!

89
00:05:20,702 --> 00:05:23,77
Shadow X, Spinning Cutter!

90
00:05:23,77 --> 00:05:24,715
Spinning Cutter!

91
00:05:27,796 --> 00:05:29,358
Why is it so hard?!

92
00:05:29,358 --> 00:05:32,865
I see. Then, Heli-Tornado!

93
00:05:33,3 --> 00:05:35,4
Got it!

94
00:05:35,4 --> 00:05:36,918
Heli-Tornado!

95
00:05:39,243 --> 00:05:41,133
Haha! How is it?!

96
00:05:48,845 --> 00:05:50,518
Oh no, no way!

97
00:05:50,518 --> 00:05:51,336
Jun!

98
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:54,38
Blue Cop, setup!

99
00:06:04,629 --> 00:06:07,31
Blue Cop, Thunderbolt Smash!

100
00:06:12,849 --> 00:06:14,23
Thunderbolt...

101
00:06:14,23 --> 00:06:15,190
Smash!!

102
00:06:24,567 --> 00:06:26,97
Blue Cop! Are you okay?!

103
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:31,660
Where's my body.

104
00:06:32,271 --> 00:06:33,508
Here it is!

105
00:06:35,754 --> 00:06:38,278
You want it? Come take it from us!

106
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:39,300
Ha.

107
00:06:40,258 --> 00:06:41,677
Anna, let's hide!

108
00:06:49,223 --> 00:06:50,112
Do it now!

109
00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:54,947
Blue Cop! Blow the tunnel entrance with a Burst Shot!

110
00:06:54,947 --> 00:06:56,97
Got it!

111
00:07:09,167 --> 00:07:11,474
Jun, it worked!

112
00:07:11,474 --> 00:07:13,495
What happened? What?

113
00:07:13,495 --> 00:07:16,135
We did it! It's game over for the tractor!

114
00:07:19,836 --> 00:07:21,881
W-what is that?

115
00:07:21,881 --> 00:07:22,794
What's going on?!

116
00:07:39,337 --> 00:07:41,805
You brats are starting to annoy me.

117
00:07:41,805 --> 00:07:43,594
I mean it.

118
00:07:44,316 --> 00:07:48,264
All you had to do was give me my trailer.

119
00:07:49,192 --> 00:07:51,643
You will pay for this now.

120
00:07:52,268 --> 00:07:54,819
That's Heavy Iron's true form!

121
00:07:54,819 --> 00:07:57,0
It's larger than I expected.

122
00:07:57,0 --> 00:08:00,107
Seems like... he's hopping mad!

123
00:08:00,107 --> 00:08:02,683
Just because he's big doesn't mean he's strong!

124
00:08:05,404 --> 00:08:07,16
Let's try attacking in turns!

125
00:08:07,811 --> 00:08:09,752
Mega Ambler, setup!

126
00:08:13,583 --> 00:08:16,849
Mega Ambler, use Forceps Crush to stop him from moving!

127
00:08:16,849 --> 00:08:17,519
Yes!

128
00:08:29,252 --> 00:08:30,563
Forceps Crush!

129
00:08:34,792 --> 00:08:36,713
Phoenix Fire, setup!

130
00:08:40,776 --> 00:08:43,99
Your turn, Phoenix Fire!

131
00:08:43,99 --> 00:08:44,420
Burning Hammer!

132
00:08:46,879 --> 00:08:50,640
Yaah! Burning Hammer!

133
00:08:57,845 --> 00:08:59,722
How do you like my fire?!

134
00:09:00,917 --> 00:09:06,823
Hahaha. That was barely a scratch to my Heavy Iron body.

135
00:09:07,157 --> 00:09:10,82
I'll show you what true power is!

136
00:09:20,523 --> 00:09:21,949
W-what's that?!

137
00:09:21,949 --> 00:09:23,857
He's going to destroy everything!

138
00:09:27,930 --> 00:09:31,179
Iron Cannon!!

139
00:09:44,563 --> 00:09:47,291
No, Anna! Are you okay?!

140
00:09:49,284 --> 00:09:51,18
Theo. Are you alright?

141
00:09:51,18 --> 00:09:53,792
I think so... are we still alive...?

142
00:09:54,423 --> 00:09:57,301
Now you understand, you brats...

143
00:09:57,301 --> 00:10:00,722
I am the most powerful Metal Cardbot.

144
00:10:00,722 --> 00:10:02,639
Heavy Iron!

145
00:10:05,234 --> 00:10:08,469
Now... kneel before me.

146
00:10:08,469 --> 00:10:13,196
Vow loyalty to me, and I will let you live.

147
00:10:13,196 --> 00:10:16,809
You know well by now that resistance is futile.

148
00:10:27,515 --> 00:10:29,185
What was that...

149
00:10:29,856 --> 00:10:31,713
This is it, Blue Cop!

150
00:10:31,713 --> 00:10:34,46
Megavolt Punch!

151
00:10:35,154 --> 00:10:42,510
Megavolt...

152
00:10:42,510 --> 00:10:44,75
Punch!!

153
00:11:00,382 --> 00:11:03,741
I'll end it here today since I found my body.

154
00:11:03,741 --> 00:11:04,733
But...

155
00:11:04,733 --> 00:11:07,130
You will pay for this!

156
00:11:10,363 --> 00:11:12,515
Thanks, you saved us all.

157
00:11:12,662 --> 00:11:13,380
Huh?

158
00:11:15,23 --> 00:11:16,553
It disappeared.

159
00:11:18,831 --> 00:11:21,843
But... who could it have been?
