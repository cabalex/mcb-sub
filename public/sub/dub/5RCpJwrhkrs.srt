1
00:00:01,857 --> 00:00:05,110
Farewell, Blue Cop

2
00:00:06,614 --> 00:00:10,718
You can summon Mega Trucker any time you want with that card,

3
00:00:10,718 --> 00:00:12,455
and you can give him commands, too.

4
00:00:12,455 --> 00:00:13,954
Huh? What's going on? What happened here?!

5
00:00:13,954 --> 00:00:15,329
Huh???

6
00:00:15,329 --> 00:00:17,861
Uh, hello Edo...

7
00:00:22,665 --> 00:00:24,657
Stay away from Jun!

8
00:00:24,894 --> 00:00:26,547
Uh, sir!

9
00:00:26,569 --> 00:00:28,758
Edo, were you at the repair shop?!

10
00:00:28,758 --> 00:00:32,836
I dozed off while working late... then I woke up when I heard loud noises outside!

11
00:00:34,836 --> 00:00:37,100
It was you! You were the one who broke my fence!

12
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:39,170
And totally crushed Jun's bike!

13
00:00:39,170 --> 00:00:41,296
Aah, Edo, that's not what happened!

14
00:00:41,296 --> 00:00:42,674
It's a misunderstanding, I-

15
00:00:42,674 --> 00:00:45,180
Don't come any closer!

16
00:00:52,9 --> 00:00:53,985
What are you doing, sir?

17
00:00:53,985 --> 00:00:57,216
I'm going to get you, you heap of scrap metal!

18
00:00:59,567 --> 00:01:01,422
Please stop, sir, this is not safe!

19
00:01:01,422 --> 00:01:02,554
What did you say?!

20
00:01:02,554 --> 00:01:07,947
Please stop! Blue Cop is not a heap of scrap metal!

21
00:01:07,947 --> 00:01:09,210
He's from some planet...

22
00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:12,779
I am a Metal Cardbot. A mechanical lifeform from planet Machina.

23
00:01:12,779 --> 00:01:13,915
Right, that one!

24
00:01:13,915 --> 00:01:17,30
Why are you here? Are you trying to bait us or something?!

25
00:01:17,30 --> 00:01:19,168
No no no, sir! We are...

26
00:01:20,326 --> 00:01:22,445
Hey, who are you calling, Edo?

27
00:01:22,445 --> 00:01:25,289
I'm calling the cops, why? Do you think the army should be handling this?

28
00:01:26,588 --> 00:01:27,957
T-that's not a good idea, sir!

29
00:01:27,957 --> 00:01:29,259
Please, stop him, Blue Cop!

30
00:01:29,559 --> 00:01:30,388
Yes.

31
00:01:30,918 --> 00:01:32,709
Uh, hello? Is this the army headquarters-

32
00:01:33,109 --> 00:01:34,531
Waah!

33
00:01:35,505 --> 00:01:41,456
Let me go! You're trying to get rid of me to shut me up, aren't you?!

34
00:01:45,242 --> 00:01:48,286
We have to stop this misunderstanding somehow.

35
00:01:48,286 --> 00:01:49,622
What should I do?

36
00:01:49,622 --> 00:01:52,962
Just untie me already... my shoulders are killing me!

37
00:01:52,962 --> 00:01:55,513
Blue Cop. Do something about his shoulders.

38
00:01:55,513 --> 00:01:56,451
His shoulders?

39
00:01:56,451 --> 00:02:00,450
Yes! Show him you're not a bad robot after all.

40
00:02:13,486 --> 00:02:19,680
I heard on the radio that delivering a vibration of 3200 rotations per second helps blood circulation and relaxes the muscle.

41
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:20,984
Woah!

42
00:02:21,969 --> 00:02:26,288
Ohh... that's good... that's the spot. Try to really get in there...

43
00:02:33,401 --> 00:02:35,104
Ugh...

44
00:02:35,237 --> 00:02:36,400
Are you alright?

45
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:41,557
No, I'm not... I'm hurting and I'm thirsty... make me a coffee, would you?

46
00:02:42,325 --> 00:02:43,616
Yes, sir.

47
00:02:48,64 --> 00:02:49,918
So you can make coffee!

48
00:02:49,918 --> 00:02:52,277
It's a basic skill for surviving on planet Earth.

49
00:02:52,277 --> 00:02:54,820
White sugar and no cream, okay?

50
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:56,341
Yes, sir!

51
00:03:02,728 --> 00:03:03,933
Here you are.

52
00:03:11,330 --> 00:03:13,460
Augh, why is it so sweet?!

53
00:03:14,889 --> 00:03:16,909
By white sugar, did you mean... one cube?

54
00:03:16,909 --> 00:03:19,875
You're trying to give me diabetes, huh?!

55
00:03:23,632 --> 00:03:25,811
Where are you going, Edo?

56
00:03:25,811 --> 00:03:29,810
To work. I have a meeting with a partner in the morning, actually.

57
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:35,313
And you! You better be sure to get this mess cleaned up while I am gone!

58
00:03:37,351 --> 00:03:41,879
Hey, kiddo! You look like you need help. Want a hand?

59
00:03:41,879 --> 00:03:43,456
This voice is from...

60
00:03:43,456 --> 00:03:45,358
Mega Trucker?

61
00:03:45,358 --> 00:03:47,570
Jun! Let's summon Mega Trucker!

62
00:03:47,570 --> 00:03:49,932
Summon? You mean... bring him back here?

63
00:03:49,932 --> 00:03:54,480
Yes. A Metal Cardbot that has been sealed must obey the master.

64
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:55,627
Don't worry about it.

65
00:03:59,267 --> 00:04:01,208
Alright, I'll give it a shot.

66
00:04:01,608 --> 00:04:03,655
Metal Breath, pickup!

67
00:04:05,34 --> 00:04:07,277
Mega Trucker, setup!

68
00:04:12,431 --> 00:04:15,695
Hmm... such delicate work is my specialty.

69
00:04:15,695 --> 00:04:17,471
Are you sure you can do it?

70
00:04:17,471 --> 00:04:20,322
Leave it to me. Cue the music!

71
00:04:30,374 --> 00:04:32,177
Mega Trucker, you're doing great!

72
00:04:33,821 --> 00:04:35,238
Just getting started!

73
00:04:38,879 --> 00:04:41,162
Woohoo!

74
00:04:43,891 --> 00:04:44,859
Stop!

75
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:50,433
You're getting in my way! This is my favorite part!

76
00:04:55,107 --> 00:04:56,850
Woohoo!

77
00:05:00,378 --> 00:05:04,589
Aah! Both of you, stop! Stop fighting and start getting along!

78
00:05:05,85 --> 00:05:07,750
...did you guys finish cleaning-

79
00:05:12,372 --> 00:05:14,987
What is this?!

80
00:05:17,799 --> 00:05:19,856
What in the world is this?

81
00:05:19,856 --> 00:05:21,901
We... are very sorry.

82
00:05:23,422 --> 00:05:25,306
Oh, that's right! My meeting is starting soon.

83
00:05:25,306 --> 00:05:27,185
I can't waste any more time.

84
00:05:28,276 --> 00:05:30,605
Don't get into any more trouble while I am gone!

85
00:05:34,183 --> 00:05:36,200
Jun, don't you have to go to school too?

86
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:38,185
O-Oh, that's right!

87
00:05:41,509 --> 00:05:43,932
Why is everything getting in my way!?

88
00:05:45,896 --> 00:05:48,596
Looks like you need some help with that, Edo!

89
00:05:48,596 --> 00:05:51,665
Blue Cop! Here's a job for you!

90
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:03,339
So you can transform into a car...

91
00:06:03,339 --> 00:06:04,555
Yes.

92
00:06:04,948 --> 00:06:09,216
Wait... are all these cars your bodies?

93
00:06:09,709 --> 00:06:10,358
Huh?

94
00:06:17,391 --> 00:06:18,951
There's a bad traffic jam.

95
00:06:18,951 --> 00:06:20,635
Augh, but I'm in a hurry!

96
00:06:20,635 --> 00:06:21,896
I'll try my best.

97
00:06:21,896 --> 00:06:24,352
Hey, what are you going to do?

98
00:06:29,789 --> 00:06:31,183
Woah, you're going too fast!

99
00:06:38,991 --> 00:06:40,838
Oh my God!

100
00:06:43,486 --> 00:06:45,310
Hang on, stop the car!

101
00:06:45,310 --> 00:06:46,899
Come on, I said stop!

102
00:06:54,514 --> 00:06:57,462
Police car sirens should only be used in serious situations!

103
00:06:57,462 --> 00:06:59,516
This wasn't one! And you!

104
00:06:59,516 --> 00:07:02,103
You aren't even a real police car!

105
00:07:02,103 --> 00:07:03,526
...I'm sorry, sir.

106
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:09,427
Hmm... I have... something important to discuss.

107
00:07:16,636 --> 00:07:18,506
Edo! I'm back!

108
00:07:18,506 --> 00:07:20,826
Oh, Jun! What's up?

109
00:07:20,826 --> 00:07:22,947
Were you able to make it to the meeting?

110
00:07:22,947 --> 00:07:25,440
Uhh... sure.

111
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:26,542
What about Blue Cop?

112
00:07:26,542 --> 00:07:29,332
Just... forget about that robot.

113
00:07:29,332 --> 00:07:30,690
What do you mean?

114
00:07:33,626 --> 00:07:37,235
I promise not to tell anyone about you. In return, you must leave.

115
00:07:37,235 --> 00:07:41,370
I can't do that! As you know, Jun has the Metal Breath, sir. Without Jun-

116
00:07:41,370 --> 00:07:47,109
That's not my problem at all! If something happens to Jun, how will I explain that to his parents?

117
00:07:47,109 --> 00:07:50,137
So, you should leave. Go back to your planet!

118
00:07:58,764 --> 00:08:00,275
Edo, how could you be so dumb?!

119
00:08:00,275 --> 00:08:02,36
Huh? What do you mean?

120
00:08:02,36 --> 00:08:07,255
Machina planet was blown up by an explosion! Blue Cop has no home to return to, Edo!

121
00:08:07,255 --> 00:08:08,790
Huh... what?!

122
00:08:13,319 --> 00:08:16,474
Why didn't he tell me he had no home to go back to?!

123
00:08:19,276 --> 00:08:21,831
That truck seems to be a little wobbly, isn't it?

124
00:08:21,831 --> 00:08:23,446
Coming through, sir!

125
00:08:29,507 --> 00:08:30,774
Ugh...

126
00:08:43,971 --> 00:08:45,974
That's the wobbling truck!

127
00:08:45,974 --> 00:08:48,240
Oh dear... was the driver dozing off?

128
00:08:52,958 --> 00:08:56,225
Oh no! We must alert the train, quick!

129
00:08:57,536 --> 00:08:59,994
Blue Cop... where are you now...

130
00:09:04,322 --> 00:09:07,644
You wouldn't mind me using the siren now, would you?

131
00:09:07,644 --> 00:09:08,655
Blue Cop!

132
00:09:08,655 --> 00:09:10,913
Yes! Give me a command, now!

133
00:09:10,913 --> 00:09:13,987
Yes! We gotta push that truck away from the crossing!

134
00:09:17,70 --> 00:09:20,889
Hey, stop there! Please stop! C'mon, please stop!

135
00:09:33,299 --> 00:09:36,179
This won't do. I'm not strong enough on my own.

136
00:09:37,79 --> 00:09:38,73
Hey, Jun!

137
00:09:38,873 --> 00:09:40,215
Mega Trucker!

138
00:09:40,215 --> 00:09:42,245
Looks like an emergency. Need my help?

139
00:09:42,245 --> 00:09:43,937
I surely do!

140
00:09:44,349 --> 00:09:45,935
Metal Breath, pickup!

141
00:09:47,827 --> 00:09:49,349
Mega Trucker, setup!

142
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:55,999
Scoot over. I'll help you with that!

143
00:10:05,627 --> 00:10:07,110
Just a little bit more!

144
00:10:11,466 --> 00:10:12,357
Now!

145
00:10:34,430 --> 00:10:39,774
So you spent thousands of years wandering through space until you finally landed on Earth?!

146
00:10:40,474 --> 00:10:44,7
Okay... from now on, planet Earth will be your new home.

147
00:10:44,7 --> 00:10:44,867
Really?

148
00:10:44,867 --> 00:10:48,348
I'm sure we will need your help in the future.

149
00:10:48,548 --> 00:10:50,894
Don't worry, I'll take care of you guys!

150
00:10:51,24 --> 00:10:52,809
Planet Earth is...

151
00:10:52,809 --> 00:10:54,734
...our new home?

152
00:10:55,884 --> 00:10:58,873
Here, you can use these, Edo!

153
00:11:03,89 --> 00:11:05,882
Eugh...
