00:00:01,669 --> 00:00:05,309
0 Seconds to Destruction

2
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:09,380
According to the Center of Astronomy and Space,

3
00:00:09,380 --> 00:00:12,953
a meteor at about 300 ft in size is approaching the Earth.

4
00:00:12,953 --> 00:00:16,335
In today's press conference, Mowtown Mayor Mr. Jack

5
00:00:16,335 --> 00:00:20,677
said that no damage is expected as the meteor will burn up in the atmosphere.

6
00:00:20,677 --> 00:00:23,612
Anna, is that why your dad called you?

7
00:00:23,612 --> 00:00:26,786
Yeah... he said it will be a rare sight in the sky,

8
00:00:26,786 --> 00:00:28,699
so we should try not to miss it!

9
00:00:28,699 --> 00:00:30,503
Good. It wasn't anything big.

10
00:00:30,503 --> 00:00:34,597
I was so scared we had been discovered!

11
00:00:34,597 --> 00:00:39,462
This is footage of the meteorite captured by the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter.

12
00:00:39,462 --> 00:00:40,503
That's...

13
00:00:40,503 --> 00:00:41,680
What's wrong, Blue Cop?

14
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:42,959
That's not a meteorite.

15
00:00:42,959 --> 00:00:45,174
It's an escape pod from Machina planet.

16
00:00:45,174 --> 00:00:46,470
Huh??

17
00:00:46,470 --> 00:00:48,343
What? No... you're right!

18
00:00:48,343 --> 00:00:50,409
I wonder who's on it?

19
00:00:50,409 --> 00:00:53,409
Hope it's not a troublemaker like you!

20
00:00:53,409 --> 00:00:54,229
What did you say?!

21
00:00:54,229 --> 00:00:55,892
Now is not the time to squabble.

22
00:00:55,892 --> 00:00:57,746
If that's not a meteorite...

23
00:01:00,502 --> 00:01:05,870
It means a giant piece of metal 300 ft wide will fall on us since metal doesn't burn up in the atmosphere!

24
00:01:05,870 --> 00:01:08,263
The town will be blown away without a trace!

25
00:01:08,263 --> 00:01:09,569
What?!

26
00:01:09,569 --> 00:01:14,180
So, if there's someone inside, can you make it stop or change direction before it hits?

27
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:15,399
Based on the news,

28
00:01:15,399 --> 00:01:17,750
it will soon enter the Earth's orbit.

29
00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:18,995
But there's no sign of it slowing down.

30
00:01:18,995 --> 00:01:20,504
Oh no! Is it broken?

31
00:01:20,504 --> 00:01:23,411
Is the guy in there asleep or something?

32
00:01:23,411 --> 00:01:25,742
Oh, so you guys sleep too?

33
00:01:25,742 --> 00:01:28,819
These guys even talk in their sleep and snore!

34
00:01:29,150 --> 00:01:30,682
Look at this.

35
00:01:30,682 --> 00:01:34,996
This is the drop point of the meteorite according to an amateur astronomer.

36
00:01:34,996 --> 00:01:37,259
It's in the middle of Mowtown!

37
00:01:37,259 --> 00:01:40,334
The estimated time of impact is 2:51 PM.

38
00:01:40,334 --> 00:01:42,127
Not even two hours left!

39
00:01:42,127 --> 00:01:45,878
I'll ask my dad to issue an evacuation order right away!

40
00:01:45,878 --> 00:01:48,787
But wait, Anna! What are you going to tell your dad?

41
00:01:48,787 --> 00:01:51,706
That's not a meteorite, but a Metal Cardbot spaceship,

42
00:01:51,706 --> 00:01:53,718
and it will fall on us soon!

43
00:01:54,138 --> 00:01:56,888
Even so... revealing this will be a problem.

44
00:01:56,888 --> 00:01:59,448
Yeah! Who would even believe you?

45
00:01:59,448 --> 00:02:01,701
They'll just say it's a tall tale and ignore it.

46
00:02:01,914 --> 00:02:05,689
Should we think of a more effective plan?

47
00:02:05,950 --> 00:02:07,200
What do you think we should do, then?

48
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:10,625
Just sit and watch everyone in Mowtown disappear without a trace?

49
00:02:12,722 --> 00:02:15,856
There's one thing that comes to my mind.

50
00:02:23,371 --> 00:02:24,699
Do you think he'll believe us?

51
00:02:24,699 --> 00:02:27,831
We don't have time! Let's hurry!

52
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:31,372
Anna and Theo have gone into the city hall, Jun.

53
00:02:31,372 --> 00:02:33,171
Alright, Blue Cop! Come home!

54
00:02:33,171 --> 00:02:34,179
Got it.

55
00:02:34,817 --> 00:02:35,890
How's it going?

56
00:02:35,890 --> 00:02:36,877
All done.

57
00:02:39,468 --> 00:02:40,751
It's ready now.

58
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:47,477
Great. We're connected to the satellite. We can communicate with the pod.

59
00:02:47,477 --> 00:02:49,406
Wow, Uncle Edo! You're the best!

60
00:02:49,406 --> 00:02:51,795
Rgh... don't call me Uncle!

61
00:02:52,485 --> 00:02:54,585
Ahem.

62
00:02:54,585 --> 00:02:59,343
Notice to the escape pod! Decelerate immediately and prepare for landing!

63
00:02:59,343 --> 00:03:03,342
I repeat! Decelerate immediately! Prepare for landing right away!

64
00:03:03,342 --> 00:03:04,344
An evacuation order?

65
00:03:04,344 --> 00:03:07,890
That's not a meteorite! It's a spaceship from Machina planet-

66
00:03:07,890 --> 00:03:10,990
No, Anna, no...

67
00:03:10,990 --> 00:03:12,211
You said you were an amateur astronomer, right?

68
00:03:12,211 --> 00:03:15,498
Could you explain exactly what my daughter is saying?

69
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:27,401
My analysis showed that the meteorite consists of Hafnium and Zirconium materials with char used in the outer shell of the space vehicle,

70
00:03:27,401 --> 00:03:31,181
so there is the concern that it will not burn up in the atmosphere, crashing into the Earth as it falls!

71
00:03:31,537 --> 00:03:32,891
Are you sure?

72
00:03:32,891 --> 00:03:35,661
I heard it from Blue Cop! It must be true!

73
00:03:35,661 --> 00:03:36,783
Blue Cop?

74
00:03:36,783 --> 00:03:39,591
It's... the name of my friend's horse!

75
00:03:39,591 --> 00:03:41,929
I don't get it. A horse told you?

76
00:03:41,929 --> 00:03:45,620
No no no! It's the name of a kind robot called Metal Cardbot.

77
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:47,211
I don't understand what you're saying.

78
00:03:47,211 --> 00:03:48,185
Daddy!

79
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:53,405
This meteorite is being observed by the space institutes around the world,

80
00:03:53,405 --> 00:03:57,459
so don't worry! We don't want to cause widespread panic, right?

81
00:03:59,336 --> 00:04:00,479
Hey, Anna!

82
00:04:01,217 --> 00:04:02,807
Uh... have a nice day!

83
00:04:04,509 --> 00:04:07,753
How could he... he didn't even want to listen to a word I said!

84
00:04:07,753 --> 00:04:09,860
Theo here. Mission failed.

85
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:13,818
We just have an hour left! You hide in the basement with Anna!

86
00:04:17,425 --> 00:04:18,896
And the escape pod?

87
00:04:18,896 --> 00:04:20,428
No word from it!

88
00:04:20,428 --> 00:04:23,610
Hey, are they hearing what you are saying?

89
00:04:23,610 --> 00:04:25,264
It's a code used by all Metal Cardbots.

90
00:04:25,264 --> 00:04:26,781
If they can't hear it...

91
00:04:26,781 --> 00:04:28,911
I think... their communicator might be broken!

92
00:04:28,911 --> 00:04:32,545
Then the pod will crash, and it will be over for all of us.

93
00:04:32,545 --> 00:04:34,550
No way!

94
00:04:34,550 --> 00:04:36,637
Isn't there something else we can try?

95
00:04:38,215 --> 00:04:40,629
Let's try sending a control protocol.

96
00:04:40,629 --> 00:04:41,281
What's that?

97
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:44,987
It's a program that allows us to remotely control the escape pod.

98
00:04:50,144 --> 00:04:51,273
We're connected.

99
00:04:52,771 --> 00:04:55,168
I will change its course now.

100
00:04:55,168 --> 00:04:56,441
That's great!

101
00:05:01,259 --> 00:05:03,495
The meteorite changed its course...

102
00:05:03,495 --> 00:05:08,839
The space center reported it seems to be accelerating, but the cause could not be confirmed.

103
00:05:08,839 --> 00:05:10,620
Where is it going to fall?

104
00:05:19,879 --> 00:05:22,470
That's the escape pod.

105
00:05:24,185 --> 00:05:27,401
The drop point will be about 500 km southwest of Mowtown.

106
00:05:27,401 --> 00:05:29,564
That is... above the ocean.

107
00:05:29,564 --> 00:05:30,393
Then...

108
00:05:30,393 --> 00:05:32,298
It's a success, Uncle Edo!

109
00:05:32,298 --> 00:05:34,824
We did it, Jun!

110
00:05:34,824 --> 00:05:38,567
Mayor Jack held an emergency conference to announce that the meteorite approaching Earth

111
00:05:38,567 --> 00:05:42,536
is falling into the sea about 3 miles southwest of Mowtown.

112
00:05:42,536 --> 00:05:45,800
Haha, they did it Anna! The meteorite changed its course-

113
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:47,920
Anna?

114
00:05:48,173 --> 00:05:50,930
What? Anna?

115
00:05:50,930 --> 00:05:51,505
Is that...

116
00:05:51,505 --> 00:05:53,363
It's getting closer and closer!

117
00:05:53,363 --> 00:05:55,350
Hang on, I can't hear-

118
00:05:56,290 --> 00:05:58,540
What's... that...?

119
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:02,220
Did they separate the escape pod?

120
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:04,879
Separate, you said?

121
00:06:04,879 --> 00:06:08,110
I think they took off a part of the pod to change its course?

122
00:06:08,110 --> 00:06:09,194
B-b-what?!

123
00:06:09,721 --> 00:06:11,958
Where is that falling?!

124
00:06:11,958 --> 00:06:14,339
What?! A residential area in Mowtown?!

125
00:06:15,161 --> 00:06:17,800
Anybody home?

126
00:06:18,562 --> 00:06:21,223
Oh! So it was here!

127
00:06:27,454 --> 00:06:29,908
It will land in about 10 more minutes.

128
00:06:29,908 --> 00:06:31,172
Anna...

129
00:06:36,223 --> 00:06:37,990
There is no time to lose!

130
00:06:38,314 --> 00:06:40,670
Please, somebody help me!

131
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:43,480
But where's Anna...

132
00:06:43,473 --> 00:06:44,500
Found her!

133
00:06:47,533 --> 00:06:49,567
Mega Trucker, please help!

134
00:06:49,567 --> 00:06:50,733
Leave it to me!

135
00:06:56,499 --> 00:06:57,432
Anna!

136
00:06:59,334 --> 00:07:00,333
Jun!

137
00:07:00,569 --> 00:07:01,855
What are you doing here?

138
00:07:02,418 --> 00:07:04,353
I left your birthday gift!

139
00:07:04,353 --> 00:07:05,670
Birthday gift?!

140
00:07:05,747 --> 00:07:08,887
There's no time for all that chatter!

141
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,410
10 minutes to impact.

142
00:07:16,278 --> 00:07:19,540
We have to think of a way to stop it!

143
00:07:20,276 --> 00:07:24,569
I think I could make your shield even stronger with a little tricking.

144
00:07:25,101 --> 00:07:27,975
Really? Then let's do it right away!

145
00:07:27,975 --> 00:07:33,180
It's not that easy. The stronger the shield, the more energy it consumes, you know?

146
00:07:34,627 --> 00:07:35,757
Your shield!

147
00:07:35,757 --> 00:07:37,836
What about my shield?

148
00:07:37,836 --> 00:07:40,692
Now it's time to put everyone's strength together!

149
00:07:41,691 --> 00:07:44,557
This will sync your power generators.

150
00:07:44,557 --> 00:07:47,755
Then, you can use Mega Trucker's shield to create a barrier shield!

151
00:07:47,755 --> 00:07:51,939
Great! Send me all your energy right now!

152
00:07:51,939 --> 00:07:54,334
Phoenix Fire, do you think you can handle all of the energy?

153
00:07:54,334 --> 00:07:57,122
I wonder... what if it fails?

154
00:07:57,122 --> 00:08:00,971
You must not think that way! I believe in you guys!

155
00:08:00,971 --> 00:08:04,898
I know you will keep our town safe by working all together!

156
00:08:04,898 --> 00:08:07,254
Don't worry, we'll do it!

157
00:08:07,254 --> 00:08:09,910
Y-Yes! Let's do our best!

158
00:08:09,910 --> 00:08:11,843
I believe in you too.

159
00:08:11,843 --> 00:08:13,788
Jun. You are our friend.

160
00:08:22,673 --> 00:08:24,435
I believe in you too!

161
00:08:24,435 --> 00:08:25,706
Thank you.

162
00:08:25,706 --> 00:08:28,495
Let's prove them right for having faith in us.

163
00:08:29,954 --> 00:08:32,111
Alright. Everyone, get ready!

164
00:08:32,111 --> 00:08:33,234
Okay!

165
00:08:39,225 --> 00:08:40,587
We are ready!

166
00:08:41,179 --> 00:08:42,554
Okay!

167
00:08:42,554 --> 00:08:44,722
Energy full charge!

168
00:09:24,769 --> 00:09:25,868
Blue Cop?!

169
00:09:25,868 --> 00:09:28,687
It's okay, Mega Trucker! I got your back!

170
00:09:29,158 --> 00:09:30,501
I'll help, too!

171
00:09:30,501 --> 00:09:31,244
Me too!

172
00:09:33,822 --> 00:09:35,937
Guys! You're doing great!

173
00:09:40,408 --> 00:09:43,414
Everyone, give it all the energy you've got!

174
00:09:48,678 --> 00:09:50,341
Ultra... Mega...

175
00:09:50,341 --> 00:09:52,404
Power Shield!!

176
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,235
You did it...

177
00:10:17,782 --> 00:10:19,448
Are you alright, Mega Trucker?

178
00:10:19,448 --> 00:10:21,886
This is nothing! I'm fine!

179
00:10:22,793 --> 00:10:23,553
Jun...

180
00:10:23,943 --> 00:10:25,509

I want you to know, I'll promise I will keep the Metal Cardbots a secret.

00:10:29,163 --> 00:10:31,756
Thank you, Anna... and...

183
00:10:31,756 --> 00:10:34,409
Sorry I lied all this time.

184
00:10:34,409 --> 00:10:38,580
No, no! I'm sure I would have done the same if I were you.
